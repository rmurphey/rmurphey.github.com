<div class="entry-content"><p>One of my personal goals for this year was to start being part of the solution to the dearth of female speakers at tech events. Though I&rsquo;ve talked at a couple of smallish local events over the past few months, this past weekend I got to do it in a big way: I presented a talk on using objects to organize your jQuery code to an audience of around 100 people, more by far than I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to before.</p>




<p>[This post isn&rsquo;t so much about the talk itself as my first experience with talking at a conference. If you&rsquo;re interested in the talk, I encourage you to check out the slides, links, and code at the link above.]</p>




<p>I decided I wanted to try to talk at the jQuery conference after I saw the initial very smart, very male speaker lineup. I submitted my talk based on an article I wrote earlier this year, and by the time it was all said and done, mine was the second most popular topic and I was slated to have 30 minutes in &ldquo;the big room.&rdquo;</p>




<p>There is something sort of out-of-body about that moment when I am standing in front of a roomful of people right before I talk &mdash; I had it when I gave my first Refresh talk, when I taught my first jQuery class, when I spoke at my first BarCamp RDU, and yet again this weekend. For that moment, in my head, I am a complete and utter case, and can&rsquo;t quite fathom that I thought this was a good idea. And then I start talking, and then it is OK. And then when it&rsquo;s over, people clap, and I like that part.</p>




<p>Back when I set out to start speaking more, I decided to take an improv class. For six weeks, we practiced being spontaneously funny, and at the end, we got up on stage in front of a bunch of strangers and tried to do it for real. Knowing what that feels like &mdash; what it feels like to run up the aisle like you&rsquo;re excited when really you&rsquo;re terrified because you&rsquo;ve never done this before and in real life you sit at a desk all day and talk to no one and what were you thinking? &mdash; makes the thought of talking to a bunch of strangers about what you actually know how to do seem like a completely reasonable thing.</p>




<p>My experience this weekend was nothing short of excellent &mdash; people I barely knew rallied around me throughout the weekend to help me improve my presentation (most notably Chris Williams, organizer of JSConf, to whom I owe many thanks for all the images &mdash; especially the Liger). The audience graciously tolerated the part in the middle where I had to leave the podium to (very publicly) blow my nose. People asked great questions, and audience members gently pointed out things I might want to rethink. With the exception of one creepy off-the-wall comment about my &ldquo;fine-boned features,&rdquo; the reaction was overwhelmingly positive.</p>




<p>Reliable sources told me that of 300 attendees, approximately 282 were men. I was the only woman to submit a talk. So this is the part where I encourage other women to do the same. I think women, on the whole (of course there are exceptions), are way more inclined than men to think they aren&rsquo;t good enough speakers, that they don&rsquo;t know a topic well enough to tell it to other people. Two truths: one, the speaking skills of the speakers I&rsquo;ve seen have been all over the map; two, you&rsquo;d be surprised how much you actually know about a topic, especially given the right audience. Go speak at a small event &mdash; a local meetup, a Refresh, even a lunch-and-learn at your office. Get to know the people who do speak at events, and discover that they&rsquo;re people just like you. Go out on a limb and try something that&rsquo;s</p>
