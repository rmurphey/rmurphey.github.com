  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got done with an emergency project for an agency developing a public-facing application for a mutinational technology client you&#8217;ve most certainly heard of. I developed the entire front-end &#8211; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript &#8211; for a non-trivial application with a limited spec in just seven days. The experience was so eye-opening that I feel the need to write down some of the things I&#8217;ve learned, in hopes that I can benefit from my experience in the future.</p>




<ul>
    <li>Demand all technical source material up front, such as functional specs, mockups, work that&#8217;s been done to date, etc. Give the client a fixed amount of time to deliver that source material, and don&#8217;t make a decision about taking on the project until you&#8217;ve seen it. What the client can deliver in that fixed amount of time will shed a lot of light on the state of the project and whether their expectations are realistic.</li>
    <li>Set clear time expectations. Am I willing to work 16 hours a day? Am I expected to? Are there hours during which I&#8217;ll be expected to be available? Am I willing to work on the weekend?</li>
    <li>Find out whether the client expects me to be available after the imminent deadline, and to what extent. The last thing I want is to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by being unable to support the code I&#8217;ve written.</li>
    <li>Do not accept responsibility for commitments made on my behalf. The recruiter said I&#8217;d be available six hours a day when I told him four? Not my problem. The client committed to having a feature ready for review without consulting me? They probably won&#8217;t make that mistake again.</li>
    <li>Ascertain the rest of the team&#8217;s commitment to the project. If I&#8217;m expected to work long hours, will they be there during those long hours to get me what I need? Are there any constraints on their availability?</li>
    <li>Establish a single point of contact at the client, and make clear I&#8217;ll be depending on them to get me any information I need and I&#8217;ll be treating their decisions as final. Insist that they participate in all calls I&#8217;m expected to participate in.</li>
    <li>Limit the amount of work I do before I have access to all client systems I&#8217;ll need access to: version control, testing environments, ticketing systems, etc.</li>
    <li>Insist on a ticketing system. I&#8217;m new to the project and I have a lot to get up to speed on. I don&#8217;t want emails flying at me from all directions &#8211; decisions and technical requirements need to be documented in a single place that everyone can see. This is my only insurance when someone wants to know why something isn&#8217;t done, or why it wasn&#8217;t done the way they expected.</li>
    <li>Insist on version control, even if it&#8217;s something crappy like CVS. I&#8217;ll need a way to make sure the rest of the team has access to my latest and greatest. FTP blows, especially when I&#8217;m FTPing to a server where another developer is constantly deploying a new build, overwriting my work.</li>
</ul>




<p>What other advice do you have?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is a reprint of an article that originally appeared in the October
issue of <a href="http://jsmag.com">JSMag</a>.</em></p>




<p>I recently had the opportunity to architect the front-end of a new web
application from scratch, and after years of using <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, I decided to give <a
href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo</a> a try. For a variety of reasons &mdash;
not least of which was Dojo&rsquo;s approach to code organization and
dependency management &mdash; I thought this would be a good project to get
some real-world Dojo experience under my belt. What follows is an overview of
Dojo from the perspective of an avid jQuery user.  I&rsquo;ve been using jQuery
for years. Its simplicity is seductive; after a while, it kind of writes
itself. And maybe that was my problem: I was ready to try something new. Many
months ago, I wrote on Twitter that I was interested in learning more about
Dojo. <a href="http://blog.reybango.com/">Rey Bango</a>, jQuery evangelist,
wrote back, and put me in touch with <a
href="http://higginsforpresident.com">Pete Higgins</a>, the Dojo project lead.
Pete proceeded to lobby me for months to give his &ldquo;unified toolkit&rdquo;
a try.  I dabbled. I read the docs. Pete plied me with sample code to show me
what I was missing, and even drove to North Carolina to lead a Dojo camp. In
August, I decided it was time to stop dabbling and dive in. I&rsquo;d just
finished writing some essentially library-less JavaScript for a web-based
iPhone application, a task that left me much more confident in my knowledge of
JavaScript. With the mobile site out of the way, the client was ready to build
the desktop version, and I would be in charge of the front end.   It was time
to choose a library; this time, I chose Dojo.</p>




<h2>Deciding on Dojo</h2>




<p>The decision to try a new library on a client project was a tough one
&mdash; I knew that I could write the basic functionality of the site using
jQuery a whole lot faster than I would write it with Dojo, simply because I
knew my way around jQuery so much better. Using Dojo would mean I&rsquo;d be
looking up a lot of things, from simple stuff like how to work with DOM
selections, to more complicated tasks like how to structure my code for the
purposes of reuse and abstraction.   As my work on the project progressed and
the deadline neared, I had plenty of second thoughts. A few things convinced me
to stick with Dojo when the going got tough:</p>


<p> <ul> <li>Code organization
patterns: Dojo provides pretty clear guidance on structuring both your features
and your codebase. I&rsquo;ve given a lot of thought to organizing jQuery code.
I wrote an article on the topic for JSMag and gave a presentation on the topic
at the jQuery conference. I was eager to try a library that explicitly answers
the organization question. </li> <li>Class inheritance: I knew from the start
that I was going to use a lot of interaction patterns over and over. I wanted
to be able to write those patterns in a way that would let me use them across
features while still staying DRY. The class inheritance provided by
<code>dojo.declare()</code> was an elegant, easy-to-use solution to the
problem.</li> <li>Dependency management: Being able to easily manage
dependencies was a huge draw for me; it promotes reuse and abstraction in a big
way. Dojo&rsquo;s dependency management would also pave the way to easily
building production-ready files that would combine all the necessary
functionality for a given type of page, reducing the number of HTTP requests
required.</li> <li>Service method descriptions: This particular application
relied on XHRs (AJAX) in a big way. Dojo&rsquo;s service method description
approach would let me manage the URLs and parameters for those requests in a
single place, keeping pieces that might change separate from the core code.
Eventually, theoretically, the server-side code could actually generate this
SMD file automatically. More on this in a bit.</li> <li>Templating: All the XHR
responses were JSON, which I&rsquo;d need to turn into HTML. jQuery has
templating plugins to solve this problem, so this wasn&rsquo;t really a
differentiating factor, but nonetheless it was going to make my life easier. I
could maintain the templates for turning JSON into HTML separately from my
JavaScript, and even programmatically choose the template depending on the
situation. </li> <li>The meaning of <code>this</code>: When binding a function
to an event on an element in jQuery, <code>this</code> inside the function
refers to the element that triggered the event. This is arguably desirable for
simple code, but when you start organizing your code into objects with methods
and you want this to refer to the object, not the element, it can get painful.
The <code>dojo.hitch()</code> method lets you cleanly change the meaning of
this for any given function, and it&rsquo;s transparently rolled into other
methods, such as <code>dojo.connect()</code> for event binding.</li>
<li>Documentation and support: Dojo has a reputation for poor documentation,
and to some extent it&rsquo;s deserved. Their documentation is a whole lot
harder to use than jQuery&rsquo;s because, at first glance, it&rsquo;s quite a
bit more scattered and substantially more API-based than task-based. However,
once I figured out <a href="http://docs.dojocampus.org/manual/index">where to
look for the docs I needed</a>, finding answers to my questions was pretty
painless. I also leaned heavily on some experienced Dojo developers for
guidance and support, and dropped in to the ever-helpful #dojo IRC channel on
Freenode if I got stuck.</li> </ul></p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>




<p>The first step was assembling my new toy. I opted to use the library via
Google&rsquo;s CDN so I could get up and running as quickly as possible. After
that, it was time to figure out  how I&rsquo;d organize my files.   Dojo
actively supports namespaces for components, which means you can put your
application files in one or more directories and associate your namespaces with
those directories. I created a high-level controller file in the root /js
directory; it would be responsible for figuring out which functionality was
required for a given page (a decision I&rsquo;ll eventually revisit). Then, I
created a directory inside the root /js directory, where I&rsquo;d put all of
the individual files for the various components.  </p>




<p>Finally, I included a line in my controller file to tell Dojo where to find
the namespace I&rsquo;d be using:  <code>dojo.registerModulePath('myNamespace',
'../js/myNamespace');</code> Figuring out all of these pieces may have been the
hardest part of making the switch to Dojo &mdash; it was a whole lot more setup
than I was used to with jQuery, and though it is all documented, it took a bit
of effort to find the details and to get the paths set up correctly. The time
it took to get everything working properly was time that I spent wondering
whether I&rsquo;d made a good decision. Once it was working, it was time to
write some actual code and try to answer that question.</p>




<h2>Get Some Elements, Do Something With Them</h2>




<p>Those words sum up the jQuery paradigm. In jQuery, you query the DOM using a
CSS selector, and the result of that query is a jQuery object, which you can
then operate on using method chains. It&rsquo;s fairly rare in jQuery to work
directly with a DOM element. While Dojo supports this paradigm through its
dojo.query() method and the NodeList it returns, it&rsquo;s common in Dojo to
work directly with a DOM element rather than a NodeList.   My initial
inclination was to stick with what I knew from jQuery, and to use
<code>dojo.query()</code> to get everything I wanted to work with. As I dug in,
though, I discovered that it could actually be just as elegant (and less
expensive) to work directly with DOM elements, even though they didn&rsquo;t
come with any of the magic of a jQuery object. The syntax for doing so was a
bit different &mdash; for example, <code>dojo.addClass(myDomElement,
&lsquo;foo&rsquo;)</code> instead of
<code>$(myDomElement).addClass(&lsquo;foo&rsquo;)</code> &mdash; but the more
code I wrote, the more frequently and easily I found myself using the
dojo.addClass syntax instead.   Embracing this approach was especially valuable
when it came to methods that returned something. For example, the
<code>dojo.connect()</code> method (used to connect events to elements, similar
to <code>$().bind()</code>) returns a connection object, which can be stored
and disconnected later without having to know which element the event was
attached to. This is, in a word, awesome. It&rsquo;s also an example of how
Dojo requires you to think somewhat differently about how you write your
JavaScript.</p>




<h2>Returning a Result For the Win</h2>




<p>Along those lines, I had to get used to the fact that a lot of Dojo methods
returned objects that I could talk to later. For example,
<code>dojo.animateProperty()</code> created an animation object which could
later be play()&rsquo;d. All of the XHR methods &mdash; and asynchronous
methods in general &mdash; returned a &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; object, to which I
could later add success and failure callbacks.  jQuery does return the native
XHR object from its <code>$.ajax()</code> method, so you can technically add
callbacks there too. What I liked about Dojo&rsquo;s deferred approach is that
it provides a common, simple interface for interacting with all asynchronous
operations, and even lets you define your own.  Getting the hang of how to take
advantage of these things took some doing, coming from the more procedural,
chained world of jQuery, where just about everything returns a jQuery object.
Soon, though, I was setting up animations long before I was ready to play them,
and adding callbacks to XHRs after they started.</p>




<h2>SMDs: A Unified Way to Talk to the Server</h2>




<p>One thing I really wanted to try with Dojo was making use of Service Method
Descriptions, or SMDs. An SMD file basically contains information about all of
the services provided by a resource. In my case, the resource was the
server-side application, which I&rsquo;d be communicating with to request JSON
data.  By creating an SMD file, and then instantiating a new Service based on
that file, I could create a single place for managing all the paths and
parameters I&rsquo;d use to get what I needed from the server. When I asked the
server for something, the Service I created would return a deferred object, to
which I could attach callbacks. In the background, Dojo was just running an
XHR, but my individual classes didn&rsquo;t have to worry about the details
&mdash; I just had to worry about the name of the method and the parameters it
required, and the Service I&rsquo;d defined and instantiated would take care of
the rest.  For my initial work, I just created the SMD file by hand, but
eventually it&rsquo;s easy to see how the SMD could be generated by the
server-side application itself.   Here&#8217;s a sample SMD (normally an SMD would
have a lot more services, obviously):</p>

<h2>Dependency Management and Building</h2>




<p>I love jQuery, I do, but this is an area where it is sorely lacking. It
offers little guidance on how to structure your codebase, how to ensure that
everything you need is loaded, or how to build your code into production-ready
files. Dojo really shines here, but again, it takes a bit of getting used to.
The base dojo.js includes a ton of basic functionality, but I had to quickly
learn to dojo.require() additional functionality as I needed it. In jQuery,
you&rsquo;d do this simply by adding another script tag to your HTML;
dojo.require() basically does this for you programmatically, but checks to see
that the required code hasn&rsquo;t already been included first. This means
each of your components can require exactly what it needs, and it&rsquo;s
perfectly safe to require the same thing more than once. The flip side of this
is that if you forget to require something you need, or if you require it using
the wrong name, it&rsquo;s not always clear exactly where you made the mistake.
Each file that will be <code>dojo.require()</code>&rsquo;d begins with a
<code>dojo.provide()</code> statement, telling the dependency management system
that it has, indeed, found the right file. After that, the file can go on to
<code>dojo.require()</code> its own dependencies, which Dojo loads before
proceeding with the rest of the file&rsquo;s code. The
<code>dojo.provide()</code> method also sets up the object chain along the
path; for example, if you <code>dojo.provide(&lsquo;a.b.c.d&rsquo;)</code>, you
can then safely do <code>a.b.c.d.e = { ... }</code>.  When it comes time to
assemble your individual files into production-ready, combined, minified files,
Dojo&rsquo;s build system is able to parse <code>dojo.require()</code>
statements and automatically include the appropriate files; with jQuery, this
is a much more manual process that can be difficult to maintain.   Creating a
build wasn&rsquo;t as straightforward as I&rsquo;d hoped it would be, and I
stumbed a lot along the way. It took a bit of doing to get all of the paths
just right, and to figure out how to have a repeatable build process that we
could roll up into our full release process. The payoff was big, though: I
could keep my files organized how I wanted them, but only serve one file in
production. The build system figured out the steps in between.</p>




<h2>Organization, Inheritance and Abstraction</h2>




<p>As I mentioned above, code organization has been a big issue for me with
jQuery. I&rsquo;ve developed some patterns that I use to keep my code sane, but
plenty of other jQuery developers have not, which can make working with other
people&rsquo;s code rather painful. While it&rsquo;s certainly possible to
write procedural, disorganized code with Dojo, <code>dojo.declare()</code>
provides a clear way to avoid it.   I talked earlier about creating a namespace
for my code and an associated directory. When it came time to start writing, I
created individual files in that directory for each component on the page.
Inside each file, I indicated which component the file was providing via
<code>dojo.provide()</code>, loaded any dependencies via
<code>dojo.require()</code>, and then created a class in the namespace using
<code>dojo.declare()</code>.   The <code>dojo.declare()</code> method takes
three arguments: the name of the class you want to create
<code>(&lsquo;myNamespace.Thinger&rsquo;)</code>, other classes you want to
&ldquo;mix in&rdquo; to your new class (if any &mdash; this argument can be
null, a single class, or an array of classes), and, lastly, an object that
defines the class methods and properties. The result is a class that can be
instantiated using <code>new myNamespace.Thinger();</code> the object
that&rsquo;s created encapsulates all the behaviors and states associated with
a particular Thinger, and you can have as many instances of Thinger as you
want.  The mixing in thing is huge, because it lets you have a class that
incorporates methods defined in another class. For example, I created a class
called myNamespace.Toggler that would show either the first item in a list or
all of the items in a list; clicking on the first list item would toggle
between the behaviors. Once the myNamespace.Toggler class was created, other
classes could inherit its behavior simply by passing a reference to the
myNamespace.Toggler class as the second argument of
<code>dojo.declare()</code>. I was able to encapsulate the Toggler behavior in
a reusable way, and keep the code for the classes that inherited the Toggler
behavior nice and clean.</p>




<h2>Event Management</h2>




<p>I mentioned earlier that Dojo has a slightly different take on event binding
than jQuery. I should also say that you can bind events to entire NodeLists
(the result of <code>dojo.query()</code>) if you want, using
<code>.connect()</code> (or convenience methods like <code>.onclick()</code>,
etc.). However, if you want a reference to the connection for later use,
<code>dojo.connect()</code> is your friend.   I created a component using
<code>dojo.declare()</code> that was responsible for managing user interaction
with a star rating UI element. I used <code>dojo.connect()</code> to hook up
some mouseover/mouseout behaviors to the element, and stored the returned
connections as properties of the component. When the element was clicked, I
registered the rating, and I wanted the mouseover/mouseout behaviors to go
away; eliminating them was simply a matter of dojo.disconnect()-ing the stored
connections.</p>




<h2>Publish and Subscribe</h2>




<p>With all of the XHR traffic occurring on the page, I wanted a way to shut it
off if the user was inactive for a little while, but I didn&rsquo;t want to
write the code for handling that inside every component that used XHR.
Dojo&rsquo;s pub/sub tools offered the perfect answer. I created a new
component whose sole purpose was to watch for inactivity; when it discovered
inactivity, it would <code>dojo.publish(&lsquo;/user/inactive&rsquo;)</code>.
Then, other components &mdash; the ones I&rsquo;d already written, and ones I
write in the future &mdash; could subscribe to the /user/inactive topic and
react accordingly.   Pub/sub is an excellent way to allow this sort of abstract
communication between components. The component that publishes a
&ldquo;topic&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t care who&rsquo;s listening; the component
that subscribes to a topic doesn&rsquo;t care which component sent it.
It&rsquo;s another example of how Dojo leads you to think a bit differently
about how you architect your applications &mdash; knowing about pub/sub can
help you write much more loosely coupled code.</p>




<h2>What I Missed from jQuery</h2>




<p>jQuery&rsquo;s event delegation-related methods <code>.live()</code> and
<code>.is()</code> were hard to live without. There&rsquo;s a reasonable way to
mimic <code>.is()</code>, but no out-of-the-box replacement for
<code>.live()</code> &mdash; you end up writing your event delegation yourself.
Dojo does have <code>dojo.behavior()</code>, which automatically binds event
handlers to elements that match a given selector as they&rsquo;re added to the
page; however, the event handlers are bound to individual elements, and
there&rsquo;s no way to provide a context to the selector that you pass to
<code>dojo.behavior()</code>.   This may be my noob-ness talking, or maybe
I&rsquo;m just used to the error messages I&rsquo;d see when I did something
wrong with jQuery, but I often found myself feeling that the error messages
from Dojo were too cryptic. Worse, sometimes I&rsquo;d do something wrong and
it would seem to fail silently. I spent a lot more time in Firebug tracking
down the errors of my ways.  In general, the thing I really missed from jQuery
was the &ldquo;it just works&rdquo; aspect of the library. I expect that with
time I&rsquo;ll feel that way about Dojo, but in the meantime there are
definitely growing pains. I had to constantly remind myself that the way to
solve a problem in Dojo might not be the same way I&rsquo;d solve it in jQuery.
More than once I rewrote a slew of code when I discovered some Dojo methodology
or approach I hadn&rsquo;t known about before.</p>




<h2>Conclusion</h2>




<p>Lest Rey worry that he never should have introduced me to Pete in the first
place, fear not: I don&rsquo;t expect to give up jQuery anytime soon. If
anything, I&rsquo;m excited to see how the library and the community mature and
start answering some of the organization and dependency management questions I
mentioned above. As a library, jQuery most definitely has its place; it has
virtually no barriers to entry and it has helped usher in an era where
it&rsquo;s dead-simple to create rich, interactive websites.    Deciding to use
Dojo instead was something of a gamble. I had to convince the project lead that
it was a good decision, which was challenging considering the popularity of the
jQuery library. He asked lots of pointed questions about the maintainability of
the code if I were to leave the project, and those questions were well
deserved. If anything, though, I think that choosing Dojo has actually
increased the maintainability of the code by presenting clear patterns for
organization, abstraction, and dependency management.  Did it take a while to
come up to speed with Dojo? For sure. Will a jQuery developer off the street be
able to jump right in to the code I wrote? Possibly not. At the end of the day,
though, it is just JavaScript, and any skilled JavaScript developer should be
able to find their way around. They&rsquo;ll almost certainly find, given an
hour or two, that the code I wrote is easier to follow than some of the jQuery
code I&rsquo;ve run into that doesn&rsquo;t make use of good organizing
principles.    In the meantime, I hope to be working on the project for a while
to come, and I expect the trouble I went through to come up to speed on Dojo
will pay big dividends as the application I&rsquo;m working on grows and
matures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a reprint of an article that originally appeared in the March 2009 issue of <a href="http://jsmag.com">JSMag</a>.</p>




<p>When you move beyond simple snippets of jQuery and start developing more complex user interactions, your code can quickly become unwieldy and difficult to debug. This article shows you how to start thinking about these interactions in terms of the bits of behavior the feature comprises, using the object literal pattern.</p>




<p>In the past few years, JavaScript libraries have given beginning developers the ability to add elaborate interactions to their sites. Some, like jQuery, have a syntax so simple that people with zero programming experience can quickly add bells and whistles to their pages.  Adding all those bells and whistles, even some pretty elaborate ones, seems to be just a few Google searches away. A copy here, a paste there, a plugin or a few dozen lines of custom code — the client is duly impressed, and you’re adding jQuery to your resume.</p>




<p>But wait. Now the requirements have changed. Now the thing that needed to work for three elements needs to work for ten. Now your code needs to be reused for a slightly different application where all the IDs are different.  We’ve all seen the snippets that make jQuery (and other libraries) look dead-simple. What those snippets leave out — and hey, they’re just snippets, right? — is how to design your code when your needs go beyond dropping in a plugin or doing some <code>show()</code> and <code>hide()</code>.</p>




<h2>Introducing the Object Literal pattern</h2>




<p>The object literal pattern offers a way to organize code by the behaviors it comprises. It’s also a means to keep your code from “polluting the global namespace,” which is a good practice for all projects and imperative for larger ones. It forces you to think at the outset about what your code will do and what pieces need to be in place in order for you to do it. An object literal is a way to encapsulate related behaviors, as shown here:</p>




<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>As an artificially simplistic example, suppose you had the jQuery shown in Listing 2 for showing and hiding content when a list item was clicked.</p>

</span><span class='line'>        <span class="p">})</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>Simple enough, and yet even in this example there are several things you might want to change later — for example, the way you determine the URL for loading the content, the destination of the loaded content, or the show and hide behavior.  An object literal representation of the feature cleanly separates these aspects. It might look like this:</p>

<p>Because the initial example was incredibly simplistic, the object literal incarnation is longer. Truth be told, the object literal method generally won’t save you lines of code. What it will save is headaches. By using an object literal, we’ve broken our code into its logical parts, making it easy to locate the things we might want to change down the road. We’ve made our feature extendable, by providing the ability to pass in overrides to the default configuration. And, we’ve done some limited self-documentation — it’s easy to see at a glance what the feature does. As your needs grow beyond the simplicity of this example the benefits of the structure will become clearer, as you’ll see below.</p>

<h2>An in-depth example</h2>




<p>Our mission will be to create a UI element that features multiple pieces of content divided into several sections. Clicking on a section will show a list of items in the section; clicking on an item in the left nav will show the item in the content area. Whenever a section is shown, the first item in the section should be shown. The first section should be shown when the page loads.</p>




<h3>Step 1: Crafting the HTML</h3>




<p>Writing good semantic HTML is a crucial prerequisite to writing good JavaScript, so let’s start by thinking about what the HTML for something like this might look like. The HTML should:</p>




<ul>
<li>Make sense (and work) when JavaScript isn’t available.</li>
<li>Provide a predictable DOM to which we can attach JavaScript.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary IDs and classes (and you might be surprised by how few are necessary).</li>
</ul>


<p>With those guidelines in mind, we’ll start with this html.</p>

<p>Note that we haven’t included any markup to display the section navigation or the item navigation; those pieces will be added by jQuery since they will only work with jQuery; non-JavaScript users will get nice semantic markup. (If there’s anything surprising or confusing in that HTML, now would be a good time to read up on POSH (plain-old semantic HTML) and progressive enhancement.)</p></p>

<h3>Step 2: Scaffolding the Object</h3>




<p>My first step in creating an object for a feature is to create “stubs” within the object. Stubs are basically placeholders; they’re the outline for the feature we’re going to build. Our object will have the following methods:</p>




<ul>
<li><code>myFeature.init()</code> will run on <code>$(document).ready()</code>. It will turn the semantic HTML we start with into a JavaScript-enabled user interface.</li>
<li><code>myFeature.buildSectionNav()</code> will be called by <code>myFeature.init()</code>. It will take a jQuery object that contains all of the sections from the semantic HTML and use those sections to build the top navigation. It will bind the click handlers to the top navigation items so that clicking on them will show the appropriate section.</li>
<li><code>myFeature.buildItemNav()</code> will be called by <code>myFeature.showSection()</code>. It will ake a jQuery object that contains all of the items associated with the section from the semantic HTML, and use them to build the side navigation. It will bind the click handlers to the side navigation items so that clicking on them will show the appropriate content.</li>
<li><code>myFeature.showSection()</code> will be called when the user clicks on an item in the top navigation. It will use the navigation item that’s clicked on to figure out which section to show from the semantic HTML.</li>
<li><code>myFeature.showContentItem()</code> will be called when the user clicks on an item in the side navigation. It will use the navigation item that’s clicked on to figure out which content item to show from the semantic HTML.</li>
</ul>




<p>We’ll also make room for a configuration property, <code>myFeature.config</code>, which will be a single location for setting default values rather than scattering them throughout the code. We’ll include the ability to override the defaults when we define the <code>myFeature.init()</code> method.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<h3>Step 4: Changing Requirements</h3>




<p>No project is complete without some last-minute change in the requirements, right? Here’s where the object literal approach really shines by making it quick and fairly painless to implement last-minute changes.  What if we need to get the content item excerpts via AJAX instead of from the HTML? Assuming the backend is set up to handle it, try this:</p>

<p>Do you need more flexibility? There’s a lot more you can configure (and therefore override) if you really want to make this flexible. For example, you can use myFeature.config to specify how to find and process the title text for each item in the left nav.</p>

<p>Beyond the scope of this article (but also interesting to contemplate and much easier with the object literal pattern) is this: making the back button retrace your path through the tabs using the jQuery history plugin. I leave it as an exercise for the reader.</p>




<h2>Conclusion</h2>




<p>If you’ve stepped through the code examples in this column, you should have a basic understanding of the object literal pattern and how it might prove useful to you as you develop more complex features and interactions. You also have access to some code that you can use to build on this basic foundation.</p>




<p>I encourage you to give this pattern a try the next time you find yourself writing more than a few lines of JavaScript — it forces you to think through the elements and behaviors that make up a complex feature or interaction. Once you become proficient, it provides a sturdy foundation for extending and reusing your code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m just back from the inaugural North Carolina jQuery Camp at <a href="http://www.viget.com">Viget Labs</a> in Durham, N.C., and a couple of people have asked how it went, so I thought I&#8217;d write a quick post. I had a whim a few weeks ago to organize the camp; I envisioned an unstructured day where fellow jQuery developers could get together and talk about how they use the library. I figured that since the jQuery Conference had sold out and had a huge waiting list, getting a couple dozen people together on a Saturday in Durham, N.C. wouldn&#8217;t be that hard.</p>

<p>We had around 25 people show up to the camp today, from novices to experts, including Scott Gonzalez, a contributor to the jQuery UI library. True to my (utter lack of) vision, it was a very unstructured day, but productive and fun I think. My only experience with unconferences was at BarCamp RDU just a few weeks ago, so it took me a bit to get into full go-with-the-flow mode, but when I didn&#8217;t know what to do, I just asked &#8220;what do I do now?&#8221; and usually someone would tell me.</p>

<p>We started out by writing some topic ideas up on the wall, and quickly had enough to get started. I split off with the novices to give an intro to the library, while the main room dug into the topics that had been suggested, starting with a talk by Scott about stateful plugins. Up next was Brian Landau from Viget, showing off the code for his mapping plugin and giving an overview of ScrewUnit; then, David Eisinger, also of Viget, showed us some simple strategies for improving perceived performance.</p>

<p>Lunch &#8211; made possible by the generosity of Rich Orris, FireStream Media, Ignite Social Media, and DesignHammer &#8211; was time for informal conversations and demonstrations. Here&#8217;s Scott and someone whose name I don&#8217;t remember doing some quality whiteboarding:</p>

<p>We came back from lunch with a reprise of my presentation from the jQuery Conference about using objects to organize your code, minus FAST FORWARD but otherwise largely intact. I was grateful to have more than 30 minutes this time, and we ended up having some good conversation about code organization in general.</p>

<p>From there it was on to some great show-and-tell &#8211; people are doing excellent things with the library, and doing them with ease &#8211; and then Scott wrapped up the day with an overview of jQuery UI. Probably the biggest hit of the day was Scott&#8217;s &#8220;just one more thing &#8230;&#8221; moment, when he showed us a whole new API for using the position method as a setter, coming soon to a plugin near you. Lots of oohs and aahs about that one.</p>

<p>I said at the end of the day that this first camp was really just a proof of concept &#8211; yes, I can get 25 people to show up to talk about jQuery. I&#8217;m hoping to do another jQuery camp in January, perhaps. There are a few things I&#8217;d like to do differently next time. For one, I&#8217;d like to be a little bit more intentional about having more than one session that&#8217;s suitable for beginners &#8211; a lot of the presentations were super-interesting, but way over the heads of people just getting started.</p>

<p>Also, there were a number of people who signed up who didn&#8217;t make it, which is a shame because I ordered food expecting a larger turnout. I&#8217;d asked people to let me know if they couldn&#8217;t make it, but alas only a handful did. Next time, I think I&#8217;ll charge a token amount to attend &#8211; say $10 or so &#8211; so people will feel a bit more committed. If they don&#8217;t make it, at least their food will be paid for! Charging a few dollars will also help reduce the need for sponsors &#8211; not that I don&#8217;t love the sponsors, just that it was a bit of work and stress to line them up.</p>

<p>Finally, next time I&#8217;d like to be a little bit more intentional about setting up and promoting the event. This time around, I started promoting it before I even had a venue, and shortly after I secured a venue (thank you Viget!) all the slots were filled. Next time around, I might approach that a little bit differently, especially if I can line up a few different venue options.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of my personal goals for this year was to start being part of the solution to the dearth of female speakers at tech events. Though I&rsquo;ve talked at a couple of smallish local events over the past few months, this past weekend I got to do it in a big way: I presented a talk on using objects to organize your jQuery code to an audience of around 100 people, more by far than I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to before.</p>




<p>[This post isn&rsquo;t so much about the talk itself as my first experience with talking at a conference. If you&rsquo;re interested in the talk, I encourage you to check out the slides, links, and code at the link above.]</p>




<p>I decided I wanted to try to talk at the jQuery conference after I saw the initial very smart, very male speaker lineup. I submitted my talk based on an article I wrote earlier this year, and by the time it was all said and done, mine was the second most popular topic and I was slated to have 30 minutes in &ldquo;the big room.&rdquo;</p>




<p>There is something sort of out-of-body about that moment when I am standing in front of a roomful of people right before I talk &mdash; I had it when I gave my first Refresh talk, when I taught my first jQuery class, when I spoke at my first BarCamp RDU, and yet again this weekend. For that moment, in my head, I am a complete and utter case, and can&rsquo;t quite fathom that I thought this was a good idea. And then I start talking, and then it is OK. And then when it&rsquo;s over, people clap, and I like that part.</p>




<p>Back when I set out to start speaking more, I decided to take an improv class. For six weeks, we practiced being spontaneously funny, and at the end, we got up on stage in front of a bunch of strangers and tried to do it for real. Knowing what that feels like &mdash; what it feels like to run up the aisle like you&rsquo;re excited when really you&rsquo;re terrified because you&rsquo;ve never done this before and in real life you sit at a desk all day and talk to no one and what were you thinking? &mdash; makes the thought of talking to a bunch of strangers about what you actually know how to do seem like a completely reasonable thing.</p>




<p>My experience this weekend was nothing short of excellent &mdash; people I barely knew rallied around me throughout the weekend to help me improve my presentation (most notably Chris Williams, organizer of JSConf, to whom I owe many thanks for all the images &mdash; especially the Liger). The audience graciously tolerated the part in the middle where I had to leave the podium to (very publicly) blow my nose. People asked great questions, and audience members gently pointed out things I might want to rethink. With the exception of one creepy off-the-wall comment about my &ldquo;fine-boned features,&rdquo; the reaction was overwhelmingly positive.</p>




<p>Reliable sources told me that of 300 attendees, approximately 282 were men. I was the only woman to submit a talk. So this is the part where I encourage other women to do the same. I think women, on the whole (of course there are exceptions), are way more inclined than men to think they aren&rsquo;t good enough speakers, that they don&rsquo;t know a topic well enough to tell it to other people. Two truths: one, the speaking skills of the speakers I&rsquo;ve seen have been all over the map; two, you&rsquo;d be surprised how much you actually know about a topic, especially given the right audience. Go speak at a small event &mdash; a local meetup, a Refresh, even a lunch-and-learn at your office. Get to know the people who do speak at events, and discover that they&rsquo;re people just like you. Go out on a limb and try something that&rsquo;s</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a need today to indicate that at least one of a set of input fields was required. I was hoping there was a direct way to do this in the <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/">jQuery validation plugin</a>; while the method isn&#8217;t quite as straightforward as I was wishing for, it&#8217;s still fairly simple.</p>

<p>To start with, I put <code>class="required_group"</code> on each of the elements in the group. Then, I added a custom validation method:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">jQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">validator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addMethod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;required_group&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">val</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">$module</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">parents</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;div.panel&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">$module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.required_group:filled&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230; a custom class rule to take advantage of the new method:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">jQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">validator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addClassRules</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;required_group&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="s1">&#39;required_group&#39;</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>&#8230; and finally a custom message for the new method:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">jQuery</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">validator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">messages</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">required_group</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Please fill out at least one of these fields.&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What I&#8217;d love to see is a way to specify a dependent group without using a custom class rule, but I&#8217;m not sure what this would look like, as all validation rules are either keyed off an element&#8217;s class or the presence of the element&#8217;s name in the rules object. Thoughts? I&#8217;m open to the possibility that there&#8217;s a far better way to solve this &#8211;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Someone wrote me today:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Where I work, design is highly valued with the leader of that group being our Creative Director, back end programmers are also highly valued, but front end &#8230; not so much. Partly I think its that I don&#8217;t toot my horn but I know there are other reasons. At times, my bosses haven&#8217;t even understood what it is that I do. Back end programmers look down on front end assuming that its trivial or something that should be relegated to compilers.

I was wondering if this is a common thing or more so something that is happening at my particular company, and if you have any advice or pointers on this.</blockquote>


<p>I thought my response might be worth sharing:</p>

<p>I do think this attitude is common but not necessarily the rule. In my experience, I&#8217;ve found that by having a proven value proposition, you can gain converts and respect.</p>

<p>Front end developers are in a unique position to improve page performance (perceived and actual) by using best practices such as the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> tests. Front end developers are also in a unique position to help develop templating systems and to write thoughtful CSS, both of which help enable the rapid prototyping and rollout of new features. A focus on results and best practices &#8211; demonstrating that you aren&#8217;t just pushing pixels around &#8211; is the key.</p>

<p>Back end developers respect people who think like they do. Be mindful of opportunities for abstraction and reuse. Write <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/object-oriented-css">object-oriented CSS</a> and JavaScript. Craft solutions that are maintainable and documented. Learn and make use of <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">version control</a> <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.intro.quickstart.html">systems</a>. Look for opportunities to participate in developer conversations about new features, and understand what the back end developers are up against. They&#8217;ll appreciate all of this.</p>

<p>Take the time to teach and to learn. Be sure you have at least a passing understanding of the code the back end developers are writing, and leap at opportunities to share your knowledge. I&#8217;ve worked with more than one back end developer who was surprised to discover what all they didn&#8217;t know about the front end, and through our conversations about how we approached problems, we both learned a lot.</p>

<p>Finally: identify opportunities for quick victories, execute on them, and make the results known. Benchmark before and after. Can you reduce the number of HTTP requests on a page, decreasing both the perceived and actual rendering time? Are you keeping your JavaScript out of the &lt;head&gt; as much as possible, preventing pages from stalling while rendering? Can you write JavaScript that is primed for reuse, and demonstrate opportunities for that reuse? Has your carefully crafted CSS allowed the rapid rollout of a new feature? Don&#8217;t be afraid to tell these stories &#8211; they&#8217;ll tend to strengthen your position by clarifying the important role the front-end developer plays in a site.</p>

<p>Good luck :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been some backlash lately against CSS, and some of it seems so well reasoned that even I find myself wondering if tables are really so bad after all. From <a href="http://giveupandusetables.com/">giveupandusetables.com</a>, which says the maximum time to spend before abandoning CSS is 47 minutes, to the <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/css-rant.html">well-illustrated blog post by Ron Garret</a>, the general argument is that CSS isn&#8217;t up to the task of faithfully reproducing elaborate designs cross-browser in an acceptable amount of developer time.</p>

<p>In his post about Garret&#8217;s article, <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/css-for-layout-another-rant">Dion Almaer at Ajaxian</a> opines:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">CSS purist[s] may poo poo him and say &#8220;he is just dumb and doesn&#8217;t REALLY know CSS.&#8221; The problem though is that most developers run into exactly the pain that he describes. We’ve all been there. It drives you nuts and when frustrated what do you do? You fluster about and change CSS like a mad man until it kinda looks right. And, you never learn what the real problem was, and thus destined to make the same mistake again.</blockquote>


<p>It seems that while developers are thinking about sacrificing web standards for the perceived simplicity of tables, the viability of the design rarely enters the debate, and that&#8217;s a shame. In my experience, some of the most difficult designs to produce using CSS were fundamentally flawed from the get-go, created by designers who failed to grasp that the web is not like print.</p>

<p><strong>The web is not like print.</strong> In print, designers have near-total control over the output, because the number of new &#8220;pages&#8221; &#8211; items of content &#8211; is limited by the cost of printing. If a print designer wants text vertically centered in a fixed-height column, or two columns that are exactly the same height, or rounded corners with drop shadows on top of gradients, there&#8217;s no reason they can&#8217;t have that. The cost of printing is sufficiently high, and print graphics programs are sufficiently sophisticated, that making those design decisions has no impact on the marginal cost of production.</p>

<p>On the web, the marginal cost of creating a new page of content can be approximately zero, but to achieve that we <em>must</em> build pages that adapt to unpredictable content and unpredictable users. If we don&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t realize the economies of scale that the web has to offer. The tradeoff for that infinitesimally small marginal cost is that the rules have to be different, because the cost of implementing those print-centric design decisions is inordinately high. Instead of sophisticated graphics programs, the web has mere humans to turn PSDs into working pages; instead of content created by experts and pored over by editors, the web has volumes of user-generated content, and the ability to change it on a whim.</p>

<p>On the web, equal-height columns will cease to be equal height when the content changes; vertically centered content will outgrow its fixed-height bounds; and rounded corners with drop shadows on gradients can&#8217;t possibly be worth the cost of producing them. These are not problems with CSS that should be solved with tables. They are, fundamentally, problems with the design.</p>

<p>When I talk about this to other developers (and any designers who are willing to give me the time of day after I&#8217;m done pointing out how costly their design will be to produce), I make the analogy that it&#8217;s just as absurd to impose these print-centric design conventions on the web as it would be to use holograms for every picture in a magazine. Sure, you <em>can</em>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should</em>.</p>

<p><strong>So what&#8217;s a web developer to do?</strong> When designs reach the desk of the CSS developer, more often than not they&#8217;ve been through so many rounds of review, revision, and approval &#8211; by people far-removed from the realities of the web &#8211; that the developer has little choice but to toil away at reproducing them faithfully.</p>

<p>The best defense may be a good offense, which is to say, the burden is on you, dear developer, to educate the misguided designers. Here are some tactics I&#8217;ve used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Impose yourself early in the process, insisting on wireframes and information architecture documents (even if they&#8217;re just sketches and an outline). Identify potential problems early on, but don&#8217;t become a naysayer &#8211; make sure you offer ideas, not just criticism.</li>
<li>Push back &#8211; gently but firmly &#8211; on design decisions that have the potential to cause problems down the road. Ask lots of &#8220;what if&#8221; questions and insist on answers.</li>
<li>Be honest about how long it will take you to accomplish a design &#8211; with yourself and with your boss or client &#8211; and identify opportunities to make cost-saving changes to the specifics of the design without changing its spirit.</li>
<li>Have examples at the ready of similar problems solved in more web-centric ways. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Yahoo! Design Patterns Library</a> can be an excellent resource for this, but look also to other sites in your industry or genre.</li>
</ul>


<p>The burden&#8217;s also on you to get better at CSS. I am lucky in that, when I first started playing around with web production, I was a little intimidated by tables. A background in print production steeped in templates and stylesheets made tables seem awkward and strange to me; CSS, temperamental as it was, at least bore some resemblance to the cascading style sheets of print production programs like Quark and InDesign.</p>

<p>These days, it&#8217;s rarer and rarer (but not unheard of) that I find myself beating my head against the wall over a CSS problem. I&#8217;ve learned HTML and CSS patterns that I reuse often, and I&#8217;ve learned to spot &#8211; and speak up about &#8211; design-induced ratholes. If you&#8217;re finding yourself sucked in by the latest round of CSS vs. tables debate, take heart, stand firm, and reconsider the source of your frustration.</p>
