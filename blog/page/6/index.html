  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I wrote about a 37signals post about <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2008/06/06/skipping-photoshop-for-web-design/">the pitfalls of using Photoshop for web design</a>, I didn&#8217;t know that just a couple of weeks later I&#8217;d be helping <a href="http://dailystrength.org">DailyStrength</a> write a <a href="http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs/4013">job posting for a senior web designer</a> a few weeks later. I thought a lot about what they&#8217;d written, and the skills I&#8217;d want the person who would be working so closely with me to have.</p>

<blockquote> We are a health-based social networking site, with users who are largely social networking novices; we are seeking a designer who can help us develop a consistent visual language for the site that will be easy for these users to understand, while at the same time not limiting our power users. This job entails helping us envision and develop new features, as well as refining the current site.

We have a framework that allows rapid prototyping of new features, letting developers develop and designers design. That means it’s imperative that you be comfortable working with HTML and CSS, so you can take a rough-but-working prototype and give it the polish it needs. You’ll need to be at least as comfortable in Firebug as you are in Photoshop, and be able to communicate clearly about technical aspects of your designs. You won’t need to write any Javascript, but you should be very capable of understanding how and when it fits into an application.</blockquote>


<p>In all of my jobs, from bartending to desktop publishing to my current role as a front-end engineer, I&#8217;ve always valued it when the person giving me direction has had some understanding of my job. I didn&#8217;t care for bar owners who overlooked lousy tippers, and I didn&#8217;t care for the art director I worked for who thought one font worked as well as the next when it came to web sites. So when I found out we were hiring, I jotted down some notes about what I was looking for &#8211; specifically, a designer who knew Firebug and Photoshop, and who could take my lightly-skinned markup and polish it to perfection rather than giving me a picture of how to polish it to perfection for them.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve spent the past several weeks developing a framework for our site that will truly separate content and business logic from our presentation, leaving me largely free from mucking around in PHP sprinkled with HTML. Further, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about the core pieces that make up our site, and figuring out how to, say, filter, search and present lists of elements &#8211; any elements &#8211; using largely the same base code, markup and CSS. I&#8217;m excited to soon be working with a designer who can embrace that framework and work on further standardizing the site &#8211; a task that, til now, has been made difficult by how intertwined our markup was with our code.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested, pop over to the 37signals job board and check out the rest of the posting.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Occasionally the folks at 37signals write a blog post that seems to channel thoughts that I&#8217;ve just never put to paper [blog]. This week they did it twice, with <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop">two</a> <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1066-web-designers-should-do-their-own-htmlcss">posts</a> about how they prefer to skip Photoshop and work with HTML and CSS when it comes to designing a web site.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found it incredibly pleasant to work with designers who have demonstrated knowledge and skill when it comes to CSS and HTML &#8211; at my last job, our lead designer was also the guy you went to if you were stumped by a CSS issue. Knowing the tools means that production considerations become an active part of the design process: you don&#8217;t create an element without giving some thought to how it will be built. In the best of worlds, you weigh the cost of building the element &#8211; in time, in HTTP requests, in excessive markup &#8211; against the benefit of having it on the site, and make educated decisions about what is &#8220;worth it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never found Photoshop to be an adequate tool for mocking up a design &#8211; it just doesn&#8217;t &#8220;think&#8221; the way the web does, it just doesn&#8217;t observe the constraints that the web imposes, and it just doesn&#8217;t make accessible the parts of CSS that are truly powerful.</p>

<p>While I am no designer, I play one sometimes for freelance clients. When I haven&#8217;t wanted to go straight to code, I&#8217;ve found that another Adobe product, InDesign, can be incredibly powerful. It&#8217;s an application intended for print layout (and some of its related assumptions can be a little frustrating, such as its lack of a hex-based color picker/setter), but generally it is exponentially closer to the realities of the web than Photoshop. It thinks in boxes, not pixels, and offers paragraph-, character- and object-level stylesheets that can &#8230; cascade! Just like with CSS, you can rapidly and dramatically alter the appearance of a page once you establish the base, semantic elements of it. It steers you to think about a page&#8217;s structure, not just its presentation.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping that the number of web designers who think that Photoshop is a sufficient tool will dwindle, but I&#8217;m not sure what the route is to get to that point. Photoshop&#8217;s inadequacy in this regard is so clear to me &#8211; and to people like the 37signals folks &#8211; that I&#8217;m not sure how you persuade someone who still believes otherwise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It sounds like TechCrunch got <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/05/17/dont-screw-your-partners-over-a-marketing-promotion/">burnt</a> yesterday by some remote Javascript appearing too high in their pages&#8217; HTML. Visitors&#8217; browsers were waiting and waiting for the remote script to load, and refusing to render the rest of the page until it did.</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">All we knew is that our sites all simultaneously went down three times yesterday. After the first time we identified the likely problem as Seesmic and contacted the company. They assured us there was no way the plugin could take the site down. When it happened a second time we disabled the Seesmic plugin and the sites went back up. We identified the problem - the plugin was loading an external Javascript file, and when Seesmic’s servers were down, we just sat and waited for it for up to two minutes before timing out.</blockquote>


<p>The remedy to this, of course, is to load remote scripts in the foot of the page, after all of the actual content has loaded. However, plenty of remote Javascript &#8220;widgets&#8221; aim at the least common denominator without offering a viable option for skilled users who don&#8217;t actually want their site to break. The widget publishers simply require sites to put a remote script call exactly where the site wants the widget to appear. If the widget server chokes, the site is out of luck.</p>

<p>I wrote about a related problem with ad-related Javascript, and my attempts to get around its desire to appear wherever the ad appears, making page rendering grind to a halt if the ad network was slow. We ended up getting around that problem with a bit of utter absurdity: using an iframe that called some server-side code that would generate an HTML page that contained little more than a script tag.</p>

<p>Our solution, as it were, meant an extra HTTP request to our server for every ad on the page, just to avoid a problem that wouldn&#8217;t exist in the first place if the authors of these widgets and ads would offer some real options to their savvier users. A simple method like</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">widget</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendToElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;foo&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>seems like it would do the trick &#8211; something that could be called at the end of a page and fail fairly silently by just leaving the destination element empty. I imagine that the use of such a method is hardly out of the reach of the good folks at TechCrunch, or plenty of other sites. Until an approach like this becomes a bit more common, expect many more rants like the one we saw from TechCrunch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been coming across way too much remote Javascript that uses document.write() to insert its contents. From ad providers to video hosting services, it&#8217;s common practice to provide a Javascript tag that includes <code>document.write</code> and tell the site owner to just include it in their page where the ad or content should appear.</p>

<p>This is a great least-common-denominator approach for folks who don&#8217;t want to be bothered with understanding how this stuff works. The problem is that when an ad or a video or any other content loaded via remote Javascript needs to appear near the top of the HTML document, before the content, the site user doesn&#8217;t see any more content while the browser fetches the file. In the case of one service we tried, the initial script tag actually wrote <em>five more</em> remote script tags, each of which requires a separate HTTP request, amounting to a total delay of more than a second before the content appeared. In the meantime, the user was staring at a near-empty page.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://wonko.com/post/remote_javascript_includes_without_the_performance_penalty_part">various</a> <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2008/04/06/fix-for-slow-loading-google-ads/">hacks</a> for getting around this, which involve loading the content low on the page and using (yet more) Javascript to move it to the appropriate place once the page has loaded, but they are hacky and not necessarily foolproof when it comes to ads. My initial experiments with doing this with some ad providers led to multiple ads appearing on the page, or to the whole page being replaced with just an ad.</p>

<p>If these services want people to stop complaining that their sites are loading slowly as a result of adding these tags (and perhaps looking at least for solutions that minimize the number of scripts that need to be loaded), it&#8217;s time that they expose an API that will allow sites to include their <code>script</code> tag at the end of the page&#8217;s HTML, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom">where it belongs</a>. Then sites could call a method to insert the ad wherever it&#8217;s needed, <em>once the content has finished loading</em>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">ad</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#my_ad_container&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I grant that this would require a bit more code from the ad providers (and that their ads would load a little bit later than they do now), but the improvement in user experience would be tremendous, relative to waiting as much as a second or two for the ad — and thus the rest of the page — to load.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Update: If you&#8217;re looking for a fix to this problem, also check out <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/xhtml-documentwrite-and-adsense/">John Resig&#8217;s document.write() rewrite</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google&#8217;s AdSense ads, and lots of others, are added to pages using Javascript, and if that Javascript appears early in the page&#8217;s HTML, it can seriously slow down the rendering of the rest of the page. That&#8217;s because browsers generally refuse to do any further rendering of the page until they have a requested Javascript file in hand.</p>

<p>We ran into this with the ad in the left column of some pages on <a href="http://dailystrength.org">DailyStrength.org</a>, which appears above the page content in the HTML; when we switched to a new ad provider, which required fetching multiple Javascript files, the issue was even more pronounced.</p>

<p>Since these ads only work when Javascript is enabled anyway, I decided to use some DOM manipulation (via jQuery, which is already on the page) to load the ad script in a hidden div at the bottom of the HTML, and then relocate the Javascript-generated iframe containing the ad to an empty, visible div where the ad needed to be:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#ad_hide&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;iframe&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">appendTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#ad&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now, loading the Javascript doesn&#8217;t slow down the rendering of the content, and the ad appears right after the page is loaded.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been doing some serious work this week cutting down on YUI bloat &#8211; our site was including the entire YUI library at the top of every page, at a cost of more than 200k. Worse, because the library was included at the top of every page, the rest of the page had to wait for it to load before it would render.</p>

<p>First, I switched all of our AJAX to use jQuery, the library we&#8217;ve standardized on going forward &#8211; the fact that we had a wrapper function for all of our AJAX calls made this pleasantly easy. Then, I went through the code and figured out which YUI components were being used where. Once that was done, I was able to roll up a few core YUI files into a file to be included in the global header, and call other components only as needed. Total savings: 170k. Holy crap.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d still like to see us do away with YUI all together &#8211; <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ojay-a-chaining-wrapper-for-the-yui">Ajaxian wrote about Ojay the other day</a>, and all I could think was &#8220;OMG, you want me to use <em>another</em> library to make this library easier to use? I&#8217;ll stick with jQuery, thanks&#8221; &#8211; but considering how much javascript we&#8217;d have to rewrite, I&#8217;m at least feeling much better about 38k than 208k.</p>

<p>By the way, <a href="http://marcus.net/blog">Marcus</a> sent me a link to a great article about why this stuff matters: <a href="http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid92_gci1301766,00.html">Use &#8220;SCORN&#8221; to test the front end of a website for performance</a> by Scott Barber. It&#8217;s made me get serious about cutting down on our number of HTTP requests, and so far, it seems to be making a difference.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a note to self: <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2006/12/quick-tip-optimizing-dom-traversal">Quick Tip - Optimizing DOM Traversal</a>. Avoid bare classname selectors like <code>$('.foo')</code> when possible; qualify them with an element type or, ideally, the ID of a parent element: <code>$('div.foo')</code> or <code>$('#bar .foo')</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post about <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/greimer/entry/pre_compile_and_cache_yer">precompiling and caching regular expressions</a> came across my Google reader just as I was wrangling with a slow regex issue. Not sure my issue will benefit from this, but neat regardless.</p>
