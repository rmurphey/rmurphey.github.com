  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s been some backlash lately against CSS, and some of it seems so well reasoned that even I find myself wondering if tables are really so bad after all. From <a href="http://giveupandusetables.com/">giveupandusetables.com</a>, which says the maximum time to spend before abandoning CSS is 47 minutes, to the <a href="http://www.flownet.com/ron/css-rant.html">well-illustrated blog post by Ron Garret</a>, the general argument is that CSS isn&#8217;t up to the task of faithfully reproducing elaborate designs cross-browser in an acceptable amount of developer time.</p>

<p>In his post about Garret&#8217;s article, <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/css-for-layout-another-rant">Dion Almaer at Ajaxian</a> opines:</p>

<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">CSS purist[s] may poo poo him and say &#8220;he is just dumb and doesn&#8217;t REALLY know CSS.&#8221; The problem though is that most developers run into exactly the pain that he describes. Weâ€™ve all been there. It drives you nuts and when frustrated what do you do? You fluster about and change CSS like a mad man until it kinda looks right. And, you never learn what the real problem was, and thus destined to make the same mistake again.</blockquote>


<p>It seems that while developers are thinking about sacrificing web standards for the perceived simplicity of tables, the viability of the design rarely enters the debate, and that&#8217;s a shame. In my experience, some of the most difficult designs to produce using CSS were fundamentally flawed from the get-go, created by designers who failed to grasp that the web is not like print.</p>

<p><strong>The web is not like print.</strong> In print, designers have near-total control over the output, because the number of new &#8220;pages&#8221; &#8211; items of content &#8211; is limited by the cost of printing. If a print designer wants text vertically centered in a fixed-height column, or two columns that are exactly the same height, or rounded corners with drop shadows on top of gradients, there&#8217;s no reason they can&#8217;t have that. The cost of printing is sufficiently high, and print graphics programs are sufficiently sophisticated, that making those design decisions has no impact on the marginal cost of production.</p>

<p>On the web, the marginal cost of creating a new page of content can be approximately zero, but to achieve that we <em>must</em> build pages that adapt to unpredictable content and unpredictable users. If we don&#8217;t, we won&#8217;t realize the economies of scale that the web has to offer. The tradeoff for that infinitesimally small marginal cost is that the rules have to be different, because the cost of implementing those print-centric design decisions is inordinately high. Instead of sophisticated graphics programs, the web has mere humans to turn PSDs into working pages; instead of content created by experts and pored over by editors, the web has volumes of user-generated content, and the ability to change it on a whim.</p>

<p>On the web, equal-height columns will cease to be equal height when the content changes; vertically centered content will outgrow its fixed-height bounds; and rounded corners with drop shadows on gradients can&#8217;t possibly be worth the cost of producing them. These are not problems with CSS that should be solved with tables. They are, fundamentally, problems with the design.</p>

<p>When I talk about this to other developers (and any designers who are willing to give me the time of day after I&#8217;m done pointing out how costly their design will be to produce), I make the analogy that it&#8217;s just as absurd to impose these print-centric design conventions on the web as it would be to use holograms for every picture in a magazine. Sure, you <em>can</em>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should</em>.</p>

<p><strong>So what&#8217;s a web developer to do?</strong> When designs reach the desk of the CSS developer, more often than not they&#8217;ve been through so many rounds of review, revision, and approval &#8211; by people far-removed from the realities of the web &#8211; that the developer has little choice but to toil away at reproducing them faithfully.</p>

<p>The best defense may be a good offense, which is to say, the burden is on you, dear developer, to educate the misguided designers. Here are some tactics I&#8217;ve used:</p>

<ul>
<li>Impose yourself early in the process, insisting on wireframes and information architecture documents (even if they&#8217;re just sketches and an outline). Identify potential problems early on, but don&#8217;t become a naysayer &#8211; make sure you offer ideas, not just criticism.</li>
<li>Push back &#8211; gently but firmly &#8211; on design decisions that have the potential to cause problems down the road. Ask lots of &#8220;what if&#8221; questions and insist on answers.</li>
<li>Be honest about how long it will take you to accomplish a design &#8211; with yourself and with your boss or client &#8211; and identify opportunities to make cost-saving changes to the specifics of the design without changing its spirit.</li>
<li>Have examples at the ready of similar problems solved in more web-centric ways. The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Yahoo! Design Patterns Library</a> can be an excellent resource for this, but look also to other sites in your industry or genre.</li>
</ul>


<p>The burden&#8217;s also on you to get better at CSS. I am lucky in that, when I first started playing around with web production, I was a little intimidated by tables. A background in print production steeped in templates and stylesheets made tables seem awkward and strange to me; CSS, temperamental as it was, at least bore some resemblance to the cascading style sheets of print production programs like Quark and InDesign.</p>

<p>These days, it&#8217;s rarer and rarer (but not unheard of) that I find myself beating my head against the wall over a CSS problem. I&#8217;ve learned HTML and CSS patterns that I reuse often, and I&#8217;ve learned to spot &#8211; and speak up about &#8211; design-induced ratholes. If you&#8217;re finding yourself sucked in by the latest round of CSS vs. tables debate, take heart, stand firm, and reconsider the source of your frustration.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just solved a problem where the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation">jQuery validation plugin</a> wasn&#8217;t playing so nicely with <a href="http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Index">TinyMCE</a> &#8211; the validation plugin was trying to validate the textarea before TinyMCE had a chance to copy the editor contents back to the textarea. I was about to yank TinyMCE out of the page but a little reading through the TinyMCE docs led me to try this:</p>

<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#mySubmitButton&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">tinyMCE</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">activeEditor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getContent</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// get the content</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#myTextarea&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">val</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">content</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// put it in the textarea</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#myForm&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">validate</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And what do you know, it works. One note: it&#8217;s important to bind the content replacement to the click event of the submit button, not to the actual form submission, or else the validation may try to run before the content gets copied back to the textarea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just wanted to call attention to two excellent posts by Benjamin Sterling: <a href="http://benjaminsterling.com/better-jquery-code-1/">Better jQuery Code 1</a> and <a href="http://benjaminsterling.com/better-jquery-code-2/">Better jQuery Code 2</a>. He offers some must-have tips on style, form and best practices. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/foobar2k">@foobar2k</a> for the link.</p>

<p>One addition to his notes on caching selections by setting up references: I&#8217;m partial to giving references a variable name that starts with a dollar sign, like $links. For me, it serves as a good reminder that the variable is a reference to a jQuery object.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A while back I wrote a post about tracking outbound clicks with Google Analytics; way back then (about 6 months ago), the only event that Google Analytics could track was a pageview. Now that they&#8217;ve introduced the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/eventTrackerOverview.html">_trackEvent</a> method of the pageTracker object, events that aren&#8217;t pageviews don&#8217;t need to count as pageviews anymore; instead, they can be counted as &#8220;events,&#8221; and they can be categorized and labeled.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an updated example of how to track outbound clicks using Google Analytics and jQuery. You&#8217;ll of course need to be including the &#8220;new&#8221; analytics code (ga.js, not urchin.js) for this to work, as well as the jQuery library.</p>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.button&#39;</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="cm">/* do something */</span> <span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a classic case of &#8220;just because you can, doesn&#8217;t mean you should.&#8221; This little bit of jQuery will, indeed, find every element on a page with a class of &#8220;button&#8221;, but that&#8217;s exactly the problem: it has to look at every element on the page to figure out which ones match the selector. It seems short and sweet, like so much of jQuery is, but on a page with a lot of elements, this selector can actually take a non-trivial amount of time to run.</p>

<p>There are a few ways to avoid this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the element you&#8217;re after has an ID attribute, use it. That&#8217;s the single-fastest way to find an element. However, don&#8217;t gratuitously add ID attributes to elements; the other methods below are perfectly good.</li>
<li>Specify the type of element you&#8217;re after. For example, <code>$('input.button')</code>. This will tell jQuery that it&#8217;s only looking for inputs, so it can disregard anything on the page that isn&#8217;t an input. If you&#8217;re looking for multiple element types, tell jQuery that: <code>$('input.button, a.button')</code>
</li>
<li>Give jQuery some information about where to look for the element. For example: <code>$('#myForm .button')</code>
</li>
<li>Use an element you&#8217;ve already found to tell jQuery where to find the element:


<figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">$ul</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#myUnorderedList&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">$li</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">$ul</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;.selected&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent more time than was reasonable trying to figure out why some Javascript I was using to show a Google map on one site wasn&#8217;t working to show the map on another site. The map controls and copyright were rendering, but there was no actual map.</p>

<p>Turns out the problem wasn&#8217;t with my Javascript; I had a CSS rule that was setting overflow:hidden on all divs within a container, and the divs created by the Google map API were getting that rule too. No good. I wrote a new CSS rule to set overflow:visible on all divs inside the map container &#8211; problem solved.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time lately turning other people&#8217;s designs into working websites, and often there are a few rounds of back-and-forth before I have everything I need. Some notes on must-have pieces before I can begin work:</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>
<strong>Custom fonts. </strong>If the design includes fonts that aren&#8217;t on <a href="http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html">this list</a>, then either the designer needs to provide a PSD that has all instances of the font being used in the design, or else I&#8217;m going to need the font file in order to create them. (There may be <a href="http://clagnut.com/blog/1798/">licensing</a> <a href="http://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/20050425novalis">issues</a> here, which I leave as an exercise for the reader. In print land, we were allowed to provide the print shop with the fonts required to produce a printed piece, and the print shop was not supposed to retain them once the print run was complete. I imagine something similar applies to web production.)</li>
    <li>
<strong>Navigation state information. </strong>What should navigation elements look like in the up, over, and current states? Ideally I&#8217;d like to see all of the buttons in each state, but if the variations are simple then I can probably make them myself.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Link state information.</strong> What color should links be? Should they be underlined all the time, or only on hover? What color should they be when they are hovered? When they&#8217;ve already been visited?</li>
    <li>
<strong>Form treatment.</strong> If the site has any forms on it, what should form elements &#8211; text inputs, submit buttons and input labels &#8211; look like?</li>
    <li>
<strong>Typography specifications.</strong> Decisions about these can dramatically affect the feel of the site, and you may not want to leave them up to me. Specifically:
<ul>
    <li>How big should body copy be?</li>
    <li>How much space should there be between body copy lines? (Normally the &#8220;line-height&#8221; is set at 1.2 times the size of the font; increasing this can make body copy more legible.)</li>
    <li>How much space should there be between body copy paragraphs?</li>
    <li>How should headings be styled? How big should primary and secondary headlines be relative to the body copy?</li>
    <li>How should lists (ordered and bulleted) be styled?</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>Imagery specifications.</strong> Like typography specifications, these considerations should be made carefully, as they affect the feel of the site. Specifically:
<ul>
    <li>How should text wrap around an image? Should the image float to the left, with copy wrapping around the right? Float to the right, copy on the left? Leave it up to the user?</li>
    <li>If an image is floated to the left or right, how much space should be between it and the text?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>
<strong>Approved content documents.</strong> Personally I prefer a single content document per static page that needs to be created, and a content sample for any dynamic pages that will need to be created. If there are any repeating elements in the design that require content, I&#8217;d enjoy getting a document that contains their text as well. Lastly, if there are any dynamically generated content items &#8211; for example, a list of latest posts &#8211; I&#8217;d like a document that shows me how these should be formatted. This will help me:
<ul>
    <li>Make sure I&#8217;ve accounted for the pieces of the content and how they fit together.</li>
    <li>Know that all content has been considered, reviewed and approved, so there shouldn&#8217;t be too many surprises later.</li>
    <li>Reconcile the content documents with any other documentation I&#8217;ve received.</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li>
<strong>Functional spec document. </strong>Let me know what should happen when someone fills out a form. Let me know how the items in the sidebar should be gathered. Let me know where that video&#8217;s going to come from. Basically, anytime I ask &#8220;Where does that come from?&#8221; or &#8220;What does this do?&#8221;, the functional spec should answer that question. While a functional spec should be initiated long before the design is complete, it is good to review the design and make sure those questions are answered. A functional spec should also include a sitemap.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been <a href="http://www.devlounge.net/publishing/things-to-consider-when-using-wordpress-as-a-cms">plenty of rumblings</a> lately about how <a href="http://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/wordpress-theme-hacks/">WordPress can be used as a content management system</a>, beyond its core competency as a blogging platform. By harnessing the power of pages and subpages, writing custom Page templates, segmenting posts into category-based content feeds, and using handy little plugins like my brother&#8217;s <a href="http://gmurphey.com/2006/10/05/wordpress-plugin-page-link-manager/">Page Link Manager</a>, you can do some <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WP_as_CMS">pretty neat stuff</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of people have caught on, including small advertising and marketing agencies that want to be in the content and design business while staying away from programming. In my work with some of those agencies lately, I&#8217;ve often found that there&#8217;s a gap between having the idea to use WordPress as a CMS and knowing the inner workings of WordPress that allow it to be used as a CMS. Since I often find myself needing to explain the building blocks of WordPress and how to use them as part of a lightweight CMS, I thought I should write my thoughts down. My goal here is not to get into the nitty gritty of actually implementing a WordPress-as-CMS site; I leave that to <a href="http://www.rebeccamurphey.com">skilled WordPress developers</a> ;). Rather, it&#8217;s to give non-technical people an overview of how WordPress works so they can make the most of it during the site planning process.</p>

<p><em>Note: In doing my homework for this post, I discovered lots of posts that mentioned workarounds for earlier versions of WordPress. Many of these things &#8211; such as setting a particular Page to be your homepage &#8211; are build in to the newer versions of WordPress. Make sure if you&#8217;re reading a WordPress as CMS tutorial that you are reading one for the current version.</em></p>

<p><strong>Content building blocks</strong></p>

<p>WordPress offers a few building blocks for content management: posts, categories, pages (better referred to as sections), and custom fields.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
<strong>Posts and Categories</strong> are used to organize related content. By assigning a Post to a Category, it can be grouped with other Posts in that Category. For example, you could have a &#8220;team members&#8221; Category and a &#8220;news&#8221; Category, and then easily display all team members in one location, and all news items in a completely separate location. You could even have a &#8220;blog&#8221; Category, which would allow you to have a blog on the site while still using Posts to manage other content as well. (Besides allowing this type of organization, Categories also automatically create Category Archives &#8211; an easy way for your users to browse all content related to a Category, if you choose.)</li>
    <li>
<strong>Pages</strong> are used to manage static content, and are used for the site&#8217;s navigation. They can also display other content items &#8211; both Posts and Pages &#8211; that match certain criteria. (For the sake of this discussion, pages and subpages may be better thought of as <em>sections</em> and <em>subsections</em>; not every &#8220;page&#8221; (i.e. URL) on a Wordpress site is managed using a Page in the Wordpress admin, but every section and subsection <em>is</em> managed that way. When I&#8217;m talking about a Page with a capital &#8220;P&#8221;, I&#8217;m referring to the kind that you manage through the WordPress admin; when I&#8217;m talking about a page with a lowercase &#8220;p&#8221;, I mean any part of your site that has a unique URL.) It&#8217;s important to note that, using the Page Link Manager plugin mentioned above, you can easily exclude any Page from the site navigation, which makes them much more powerful for managing pieces of content that don&#8217;t need to show up in the navigation.</li>
    <li>
<strong>Custom fields</strong> can be added to both Pages and Posts. They can contain all sorts of extra information related to a content item, which can then be accessed whenever the content item is displayed.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Theme building blocks</strong></p>

<p>The design of a WordPress site is managed using a theme. Themes include a global header, footer and sidebar. They also include a variety of files for managing the design and structure of the content area, depending on the page you are viewing.</p>

<p>A very basic theme will include the following content area templates:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Latest Posts template</li>
    <li>Single Post template</li>
    <li>Default Page template</li>
    <li>Search results template (used for displaying all Posts and Pages containing a term)</li>
    <li>Archives template (used for displaying date-, author- and Category-based Post archives)</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Harnessing the power of custom templates
</strong></p>

<p>This is where things get interesting. On a regular WordPress blog, the default Page template will just display some static content that&#8217;s entered into the Page using WordPress admin, plus the site&#8217;s header, footer, and sidebar. This is fine for Pages that don&#8217;t need to pull in any other content, like, say, an About section. When you start using WordPress as a CMS, you need to start doing more creative things with the content area of your Pages by using custom Page templates.</p>

<p>For the News Page of a site, you might create a custom template that would include introductory content entered via the WordPress admin, along with the 10 most recent posts in the &#8220;news&#8221; Category, ordered from newest to oldest, and a link to view all items in the &#8220;news&#8221; category. For the Home Page of a site, you might create a more elaborate custom template, pulling Posts from a variety of Categories, pulling static content from a variety of hidden Pages, and displaying it all in a variety of ways: full content, titles only excerpts, etc. You might even make use of custom fields. Do you want to be able to show a thumbnail with each Post in the &#8220;video&#8221; category, but only when you&#8217;re showing those posts on your homepage? Add a custom field to those posts with the URL to the thumbnail, then tell your custom Home Page template to look for that custom field and use it to insert an image tag.</p>

<p>You could just as easily create a custom field containing the name of a PHP file to be used as a custom dynamic sidebar for that page; the options here are pretty much limited by your imagination (and your developer).</p>

<p><strong>Developing the site architecture</strong></p>

<p>In planning a site that will use WordPress as a CMS, it&#8217;s imperative to think of how your content, sections and subsections fit into the WordPress model. It will save you lots of headaches when it comes time to actually develop the site, and lots of calls and emails from your developer trying to figure out what you had in mind. In fact, I strongly recommend getting a skilled WordPress developer involved early in the process, to help you turn your ideas into a viable spec.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the basic process I recommend:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Develop a simple sitemap for the site. Figure out what the sections and subsections are, and how they&#8217;re organized.</li>
    <li>Identify the pieces content that will appear on each item in your sitemap, and evaluate how they should be managed. Is the content static and self-contained, such as &#8220;About Our Company&#8221; text? It should probably be managed through a Page. Is the content some kind of list of related items, such as news items or team members? It should probably be managed through Posts and Categories. Is it a secondary sidebar that appears on several pages? Consider using a hidden page if the sidebar is static or a PHP include if the sidebar uses other WordPress content items.</li>
    <li>Identify the Categories you&#8217;ll use to distribute the Posts to their proper place(s). For each category, evaluate whether you&#8217;ll need to collect information beyond title, body, and author. If so, identify these as custom fields.</li>
    <li>Identify the Pages you&#8217;ll be using on the site &#8211; including Pages that will be hidden in the navigation and used solely for placing static content on multiple pages.</li>
    <li>Decide how you will use your header, sidebar and footer to help users navigate your site. Will you provide links to Category archives? Will you allow your visitors to search your site? Will you show subpages of the Page a visitor is on?</li>
    <li>Identify which <em>visible</em> Pages will use a default Page template, and which will require a custom template, and identify the types of custom templates that will be required. Ideally, you will not require a separate custom template for every custom Page; look for similarities among the custom Pages, and try to identify the fewest number of custom templates that will do the job.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Plan the design based on the architecture
</strong></p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed the site architecture, you are ready to actually design the site. For your own sanity, don&#8217;t try to do too much design before this point. You&#8217;ll need the information gathered in the site architecture phase to guide you in developing the design document upon which your template developer will base their work; a design document that doesn&#8217;t take all of these considerations into account is going to lead your developer in circles as they try to make sense of what you had in mind.</p>

<p>Before you begin designing, you may want to draw up some wireframes that show the different elements you&#8217;ll be designing &#8211; header, footer, sidebar, custom page views, single post views, etc. They can guide the design process and be valuable to the developer who implements your design. When you&#8217;re finished, your design document should include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>General header. Note any ways in which the header should change according to the context in which it&#8217;s being displayed &#8211; for example, a breadcrumb or an indication of the current navigation item.</li>
    <li>General sidebar (or left and right sidebar). Again, note ways in which the sidebar should change according to the context in which it&#8217;s being displayed.</li>
    <li>General footer.</li>
    <li>Latest Posts view. If you are going to give your visitors the ability to view your latests Posts, make sure you design a view for this. The latest Posts view will usually include 10 posts; for each Post, you&#8217;ll usually show the title, author, date, category, body, and comment count.</li>
    <li>Single Post view. Ideally the structure of this design will vary little from one Category to another, though the visual presentation may change. This design will likely include the post&#8217;s title, body, author, date, category/ies, navigation to the next and previous post, a comment submission form, and user comments.</li>
    <li>Archive view. This will be used for viewing all of the Posts by Category, month, year, author, etc. This is only necessary if you will give users the option of viewing posts this way. Usually this view will include multiple Posts. For each post, you&#8217;ll show the title and an excerpt; you may also choose to show date, author and category information.</li>
    <li>Search view. This will be used for displaying user search results. It is usually very much like the Archive view: a list of posts, for which you show the title, an excerpt, and any other relevant information.</li>
    <li>Default Page view. This will be used for displaying Pages that do not have custom templates associated with them. Usually this will consist of the Page title and body, and potentially a secondary sidebar.</li>
    <li>Custom Page views. For every custom view identified in the site architecture phase, create a corresponding custom design.</li>
</ul>


<p>Giving consideration to how a site will be built in WordPress is a tad more complicated than deciding that it should be built in WordPress and then handing it off to a developer; of course, you can do it that way, but it&#8217;s not exactly the most cost-effective method. Understanding the system, working with a developer from the start, and doing the planning before you dive into design will give you the results you intend, and probably open your eyes to some connections and possibilities that you can then decide how to take advantage of, rather than leaving it up to your developer to see them and decide whether to bring them to your attention. It&#8217;s a lot to wrap your brain around at first, perhaps, but I&#8217;ve found that the planning pays for itself by smoothing the rest of the process and truly taking advantage of the CMS features built into Wordpress.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve spent the last couple of weeks trolling Craigslist and have been shocked at the number of ads I&#8217;ve found that seem to be looking for an entire engineering team rolled up into a single person. Descriptions like this aren&#8217;t at all uncommon:</p>


<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">Candidates must have 5 years experience defining and developing data driven web sites and have solid experience with ASP.NET, HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS, Flash, SQL, and optimizing graphics for web use. The candidate must also have project management skills and be able to balance multiple, dynamic, and sometimes conflicting priorities. This position is an integral part of executing our web strategy and must have excellent interpersonal and communication skills.</blockquote>


<p>Really.  Now I don&#8217;t know about you, but if I were building a house, I wouldn&#8217;t want an architect doing the work of a carpenter, or the foundation guy doing the work of an electrician. But ads like the one above are suggesting that a single person can actually do all of these things, and the simple fact is that these are <em>fundamentally different skills</em>. The foundation guy may build a solid base, but put him in charge of wiring the house and the whole thing could, well, burn down. When it comes to staffing a web project or product, the principle isn&#8217;t all that different &#8211; nor is the consequence.  I&#8217;ve thought a lot about this these last couple of weeks, and I don&#8217;t think this post is sour grapes about the fact that I don&#8217;t have the top-to-bottom, front-to-back web development skills that this ad and others seem to be asking for. I&#8217;m proud and confident of the abilities I&#8217;ve assembled when it comes to front-end development, and I have a rock-solid understanding of what makes websites tick.  The thing is, the more you know, the more you find out you don&#8217;t know. A year ago I&#8217;d have told you I could write PHP/MySQL applications, and do the front-end too; now that I&#8217;ve seen what it means to be truly skilled at the back-end side of things, I realize the most accurate thing I can say is that I understand PHP applications and how they relate to my front-end development efforts. To say that I can write them myself is to diminish the good work that truly skilled PHP/MySQL developers are doing, just as I get a little bent when a back-end developer thinks they can do my job.  So to all of those companies who are writing ads seeking one magical person to fill all of their needs, I offer a few caveats before you post your next Craigslist ad:</p>


<ol>
<li>If you&#8217;re seeking a single person with all of these skills, make sure you have the technical expertise to determine whether a person&#8217;s skills match their resume. Outsource a tech interview if you need to. Any developer can tell horror stories about inept predecessors, but when a front-end developer like myself can read PHP and think it&#8217;s appalling, that tells me someone didn&#8217;t do a very good job of vetting and got stuck with a programmer who couldn&#8217;t deliver on his stated skills.</li>
<li>A single source for all of these skills is a single point of failure on multiple fronts. Think long and hard about what it will mean to your project if the person you hire falls short in some aspect(s), and about the mistakes that will have to be cleaned up when you get around to hiring specialized people. I have spent countless days cleaning up after back-end developers who didn&#8217;t understand the nuances and power of CSS, or the difference between a div, a paragraph, a list item, and a span. Really.</li>
<li>Writing efficient SQL is different from efficiently producing web-optimized graphics. Administering a server is different from troubleshooting cross-browser issues. Trust me. All are integral to the performance and growth of your site, and so you&#8217;re right to want them all &#8211; just not from the same person. Expecting quality results in every area from the same person goes back to the foundation guy doing the wiring. You&#8217;re playing with fire.</li>
<li>Asking for a laundry list of skills may end up deterring the candidates who will be best able to fill your actual need. Be precise in your ad: about the position&#8217;s title and description, about the level of skill you&#8217;re expecting in the various areas, about what&#8217;s nice to have and what&#8217;s imperative. If you&#8217;re looking to fill more than one position, write more than one ad; if you don&#8217;t know exactly what you want, try harder to figure it out before you click the publish button.</li>
<li>If you really do think you want one person to do the task of an entire engineering team, prepare yourself to get someone who is OK at a bunch of things and not particularly good at any of them. Again: the more you know, the more you find out you don&#8217;t know. I regularly team with a talented back-end developer who knows better than to try to do my job, and I know better than to try to do his. Anyone who represents themselves as being a master of front-to-back web development may very well have no idea just how much they don&#8217;t know, and could end up imperiling your product or project &#8211; front to back &#8211; as a result.</li>
</ol>


<p>If your budget really is limited to a single position, you might want to consider whether you&#8217;d be better off working with several contractors with specific and proven skills, rather than a single person who claims to encompass everything you&#8217;re after. Your management overhead will increase in the short term, yes, but your headaches down the road will decrease exponentially. In the process, you&#8217;ll gain access to people who can help you evaluate potential full-timers, and probably gain some insight into the actual list of skills a full-timer needs to provide.  If you&#8217;re one of the people who&#8217;s written these ads, all is not lost. Invest in a technical consultant &#8211; probably one you can&#8217;t afford to hire full-time &#8211; to help you really understand your needs and the skills required to solve them. Often they can assist you with writing and posting the ad, and interviews too. For example, I&#8217;ll meet with a client, write and post a detailed ad, identify candidates, and interview contenders; if I don&#8217;t have the technical skills required to evaluate a candidate, chances are I personally know someone who can. Doing that homework up front, and understanding and describing what your needs <em>really</em> are, is vastly more likely to give you the perfect fit you&#8217;re after than if you just cast a wide net and see what you catch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I wrote about a 37signals post about <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/2008/06/06/skipping-photoshop-for-web-design/">the pitfalls of using Photoshop for web design</a>, I didn&#8217;t know that just a couple of weeks later I&#8217;d be helping <a href="http://dailystrength.org">DailyStrength</a> write a <a href="http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs/4013">job posting for a senior web designer</a> a few weeks later. I thought a lot about what they&#8217;d written, and the skills I&#8217;d want the person who would be working so closely with me to have.</p>

<blockquote> We are a health-based social networking site, with users who are largely social networking novices; we are seeking a designer who can help us develop a consistent visual language for the site that will be easy for these users to understand, while at the same time not limiting our power users. This job entails helping us envision and develop new features, as well as refining the current site.

We have a framework that allows rapid prototyping of new features, letting developers develop and designers design. That means itâ€™s imperative that you be comfortable working with HTML and CSS, so you can take a rough-but-working prototype and give it the polish it needs. Youâ€™ll need to be at least as comfortable in Firebug as you are in Photoshop, and be able to communicate clearly about technical aspects of your designs. You wonâ€™t need to write any Javascript, but you should be very capable of understanding how and when it fits into an application.</blockquote>


<p>In all of my jobs, from bartending to desktop publishing to my current role as a front-end engineer, I&#8217;ve always valued it when the person giving me direction has had some understanding of my job. I didn&#8217;t care for bar owners who overlooked lousy tippers, and I didn&#8217;t care for the art director I worked for who thought one font worked as well as the next when it came to web sites. So when I found out we were hiring, I jotted down some notes about what I was looking for &#8211; specifically, a designer who knew Firebug and Photoshop, and who could take my lightly-skinned markup and polish it to perfection rather than giving me a picture of how to polish it to perfection for them.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve spent the past several weeks developing a framework for our site that will truly separate content and business logic from our presentation, leaving me largely free from mucking around in PHP sprinkled with HTML. Further, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time thinking about the core pieces that make up our site, and figuring out how to, say, filter, search and present lists of elements &#8211; any elements &#8211; using largely the same base code, markup and CSS. I&#8217;m excited to soon be working with a designer who can embrace that framework and work on further standardizing the site &#8211; a task that, til now, has been made difficult by how intertwined our markup was with our code.</p>
