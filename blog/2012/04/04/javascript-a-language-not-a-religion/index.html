<div class="entry-content"><p>I have six things to say:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am in a committed relationship with my partner Melissa. We will celebrate
six years together on Sunday. We contribute frequently to political causes.</p></li>
<li><p>I was deeply saddened yesterday to learn that Brendan Eich contributed money
in support of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8">political initiative</a> that
sought to <em>rescind the court-established right for same-sex couples to
marry</em> in the state of California. It has changed my view of him as a
person, despite the fact that we have had a positive and professional
relationship and he has been a great supporter of my JavaScript career. I
think he is on the wrong side of history, and I hope that courts will
continue to agree with me.</p></li>
<li><p>I had a frank, private, and face-to-face conversation with Brendan about the
issue during JSConf. I shared my disappointment, sadness, and disagreement.</p></li>
<li><p>I have been dismayed to see this incident interpreted as a statement about
the JavaScript community as a whole. This community is made up of so many
people who believe so many different things, and yesterday I was reminded
that they are all just people, and JavaScript is just a language, not a
religion.  I shudder to think of a world where there is a political litmus
test for entry into the community.  Indeed, I am extremely torn about
introducing personal politics into my professional life*, as I fear it will
encourage professional colleagues to opine about personal beliefs that are
frankly none of their business. One of the great joys of working with
computers is that they <a href="http://raganwald.posterous.com/a-womans-story">do not care who I am or what I believe</a>;
I realize that to ask the same of people is unreasonable, but inviting
politics into the workplace is a treacherously slippery slope. Unless my
personal belief system presents an <em>imminent danger</em> to my colleagues, I am
loath to welcome discussion of it by people who otherwise have no
substantial or personal relationship with me.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe individual companies must determine how best to address these
issues, as their attitude toward them can have a significant impact on their
ability to hire and retain talented people. I support <em>constructive
pressure</em> on companies to align themselves with or distance themselves from
political causes, but I would not support a company that prohibited its
employees from participating in the political process. I urge anyone who is
hurt or offended by this incident to engage with Brendan and Mozilla
personally and professionally. Brendan is wrong on this issue, but he is a
thoughtful and intelligent person, and he is also a human being.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally: If this incident has made you angry or sad or disappointed, the most effective
thing you can do is follow in Brendan&#8217;s footsteps by <strong>putting your money
where your mouth is</strong>. Money speaks volumes in the American political
system, and there are campaigns in progress right now that will <a href="http://www.protectncfamilies.org/">impact the rights of gays and lesbians</a>.
Your <a href="https://protectallncfamilies.ngpvanhost.com/crmapi/contribute">contribution</a>
of $50, $100, or $1,000 &#8211; or, in lieu of money, your time &#8211; will have far
more impact than yet another angry tweet.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>And now I shall turn off the internet for a bit. Comments are disabled.
Shocker, I know.</p>

<p>* <em>It bears mentioning that, in certain cases, people making political
contributions are required to include information about their employer. The
inclusion of this information does not indicate that the employer supports &#8211;
or is even aware of &#8211; the contribution.</em></p>
