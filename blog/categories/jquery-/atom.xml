    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>And you should too ... for your WordPress blog that came with jQuery already installed and probably barely even needs JavaScript in the first place.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Here's an idea: Let's have an honest discussion about when a given solution makes sense and when it doesn't, rather than mocking a contributor to that discussion for choosing a perfectly appropriate tool for a perfectly mundane task. <a href="http://enterprisedojo.com">EnterpriseDojo.com</a> is a blog about using Dojo in the enterprise, not a blog about using Dojo on blogs.&nbsp;Snickering at its use of jQuery is approximately as useful as pointing to <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=jquery%2Cdojo%2Cyui">this graph</a> and saying case closed, leaving more reasonable, thoughtful people to explain <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450696/what-happened-to-dojo-in-2008/2451785#2451785">all the ways that graph doesn't tell us a&nbsp;damn thing</a>.&nbsp;</p>


<p>I want to be very clear, as the dust settles around my several recent rants: jQuery has its place, and it is a very, very big place. It is a lovely DOM, Ajax, and events library, and a great way to get certain things done quickly, especially for people who may not have the luxury of learning the inner workings of JavaScript (noble a goal as that is).&nbsp;There was a time when DOM and Ajax and events questions felt like&nbsp;<em>the</em> questions of the day, and jQuery showed us how to answer those questions using a simple, easy-to-learn API that suddenly made JavaScript accessible to the masses. Other libraries solved the same questions but those solutions felt ugly and clunky and goshdarnit, <em>hard</em>, and I give jQuery the utmost credit for making JavaScript suck so much less when all I wanted to do was show or hide or slide a thing or load some content onto my page. I'll even grant that it can be used as a piece of a large application solution, though I question the wisdom of doing so for reasons outlined in <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/on-jquery-large-applications">another post</a>. Heck, I'll even grant that "enterprises" aren't off their rockers to use it -- for the things it was meant to be used for.&nbsp;</p>


<p>What upsets me is when smart people seem to say that jQuery's victory in an internet-wide popularity contest suggests, well, anything at all when it comes to more complex needs. It upsets me because my clients hear those suggestions, look at that same well-marketed graph, and I am left explaining to them that, yes, jQuery is popular, but it's popular because it answers a small set of questions easily and well -- even for people who don't even know JavaScript! -- and you, dear client, have vastly larger questions than that.</p>


<p>At the end of the day, these toolkit decisions ought to be about more than a popularity contest; jQuery may be the right answer, or part of the right answer, but it's imperative, to me, that my clients understand the scope of the question first. It's imperative that they make their decisions based on a full understanding of pros and cons, risk and reward, cost and benefit -- not based on a graph, not based on a popularity contest.</p>


<p>So again I say: we, as a community, and especially the influential ones among us, do well when we elevate the conversation beyond that contest and acknowledge that choosing the right toolkit depends on first understanding what you're choosing the toolkit for. We do well when we educate teams and decisionmakers on the lessons we've learned in the time since DOM, Ajax, and events were the big question of the day, on the best practices that have emerged, on the situations where we've, gasp, had to look beyond jQuery -- either to other tools or other toolkits -- for the answers. And we do well when we start showing them how they can do the same.</p>


<p><em>An aside: Some people I like a lot have pointed out that in the midst of all of my complaining, I have not come out and offered a solution. This is fair. Two things: One, I have not wanted this conversation to collapse into Dojo vs. jQuery vs. YUI vs. Ext vs. MooTools vs. whatever, because if it does, I think we've missed the crux of the matter: that different tools do different things, that some set out to answer complex questions and some do not. If anyone has been unclear, which I rather doubt, my personal preference of late has been to use Dojo. I do not recommend using Dojo for everything under the sun, but I find it offers a lot of utility when writing non-trivial applications. I cannot make a compelling argument for using it vs. YUI, simply because I don't know YUI well enough. I can't even make a compelling argument for using it vs. Ext, except for licensing issues that may or may not be relevant in a given scenario. Two, if you're disappointed that I haven't offered a solution, especially a jQuery-based one, I apologize. However, I feel there are too many viable existing solutions out there already, and I haven't come up with a good reason to promote a jQuery-based solution besides jQuery's popularity. And, well, see above for my thoughts on that.</em></p>

    <link href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2010/08/11/on-rolling-your-own/"/>
    <updated>2010-08-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rmurphey.com/blog/2010/08/11/on-rolling-your-own</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of activity around my last post, <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/on-jquery-large-applications">On jQuery &amp; Large Applications</a>. A number of people have asked me why, exactly, I&rsquo;m so opposed to using jQuery as part of a roll-your-own solution.</p>




<p>To answer that, let&rsquo;s start by looking at (some of) the pieces my ideal large application solution might include:</p>




<ul>
<li>DOM manipulation tools</li>
<li>Ajax tools</li>
<li>A dependency management and build system</li>
<li>Clear patterns for code organization, such as namespaced modules</li>
<li>An inheritance system, preferably one that offers multiple inheritance, for sharing code across modules and staying DRY</li>
<li>A non-DOM-centric, loosely coupled API for communication between modules</li>
<li>A widget system that makes use of the inheritance system, with lifecycle management (setup/teardown) and templating</li>
<li>A system for maintaining templates separate from JavaScript while interning them into the build to eliminate HTTP requests</li>
<li>A system for abstracting RESTful server communication</li>
<li>For a UI-intensive project, a rich widget system pluggable to arbitrary data sources and designed with an easily-extended API</li>
<li>For an enterprise project, a11y and i18n provisions, as well as clear patterns for file organization</li>
</ul>




<p>To all of you who have said you can do this yourself, you win. I can&rsquo;t argue with you without sounding like I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;re too dumb, and you&rsquo;re probably not.</p>




<p>But here&rsquo;s my question: why? What, exactly &mdash; <strong>exactly</strong> &mdash; do you gain by putting all of this together for yourself, rather than using the pieces you need of a toolkit that provides all of this out of the box? Because here are a few things I think you lose:</p>




<ul>
<li>Integration. Is your abstracted RESTful data API designed to talk to your widget system that&rsquo;s designed to talk to your template system? That&rsquo;s hott. Now what about when a new version of one of those components comes out that violates an assumption you made?</li>
<li>Maintenance. I heart the good folks who have put together individual answers to these individual questions, but they have no obligation to continue being the good folks they are, and they certainly have no obligation to do it on any sort of schedule. Remember all those plugins that broke with jQuery 1.4? That sure was fun.</li>
<li>Documentation. I&rsquo;m going to grant you, right now, that jQuery is one of the best-documented JavaScript libraries out there, hands down. But what about all these other pieces you&rsquo;re putting together? Especially the ones you really are rolling on your own, like that templated widget thing that communicates so nicely with your abstract data API. There are a wealth of resources for understanding, troubleshooting, and using these pieces in established toolkits. Where will the next developer turn when they have questions about yours?</li>
<li>Experience. Like I said, I get that you&rsquo;re smart. Possibly smarter than me. That&rsquo;s cool. But are you smarter than the combined wisdom of a team of people that has been thinking about these questions for years? Are you sure your solution has thought through all the questions they have?</li>
</ul>




<p>I&rsquo;ve noticed that, in the conversations I&rsquo;ve had the last few days, it seems to fall to me to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that a roll-your-own solution that includes jQuery isn&rsquo;t advisable. Perhaps that&rsquo;s fair &mdash; &ldquo;you started it!&rdquo;, you might say, and that I did. But simultaneously, others argue that jQuery never set out to answer these questions, and so it&rsquo;s not jQuery&rsquo;s fault that people are trying to use it in ways it wasn&rsquo;t intended to be used. I have waited in vain to hear a compelling reason why jQuery <em>should</em> be part of a large application solution, to hear why I should recommend a roll-your-own solution that includes jQuery to my clients. The extent of the argument seems to be &ldquo;because I like it, and it doesn&rsquo;t force me to think a certain way.&rdquo;</p>




<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vciEDI3dD8I">No one puts baby in a corner</a>. Got it. But the straw man-ness of this argument has me, literally, chuckling right now. Let&rsquo;s not confuse a mythical one-size-fits-all solution with a toolkit that provides, well, <em>tools</em>. Tools to do all sorts of things, tools meant to work together, tools developed and tested and maintained by a whole big team of smart people, tools that are, actively, being used in really frigging big, really frigging enterprisey applications.</p>




<p>I very purposefully didn&rsquo;t propose a particular alternate solution in the original post, but it&rsquo;s hardly a secret that my personal favorite, of late, has been Dojo. Not because it purports to solve every problem or prescribes how to solve them, but because it gives me so many tools to use to solve a given problem. Time and again I find that &ldquo;Dojo already did that&rdquo; &mdash; they already wrote the tool I’m wishing I had. Now I don&rsquo;t have to write it, and, perhaps more importantly, I know it was written to work with all of the pieces I&rsquo;m already using, and when I use it I’m not risking duplication of code or a lack of testing, maintenance or support. Win.</p>




<p>But let&rsquo;s be very clear: no one&rsquo;s forcing me to use that component! No one is forcing me to do things a certain way, any more than jQuery is &ldquo;forcing&rdquo; me to think of my application entirely in terms of the DOM. I can write my own component if I want, or use someone else&rsquo;s if I want, or change it a bit if I want! For example, on a current project I pulled in mustache.js because the project had a lot of templates that had already been written to use it. The brilliant thing, though, was that integrating mustache.js into dijit._Templated instead of the standard templating system was trivial. That component, and all the others in Dojo and Dijit, are architected explicitly <em>not</em> to be one-size-fits-all. They provide a rock-solid base for large application development, for getting up and running quickly using a bevy of ready-made solutions, but also provide so many extension points that you can turn those solutions on their head if you want or need.</p>




<p>Garann Means, whose blog you should be reading, took a bit of issue with my original post in <a href="http://www.garann.com/dev/?p=186">model-view-controller and comfy clothes</a>.</p>




<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><p>I do agree that it benefits everyone to be working in the same setup and making use of tools that have been vetted by geniuses whose entire job is to create such things. But I&rsquo;m dubious about any approach which comes too close to promising one size fits all. If you&rsquo;ve ever sewn a dress, you understand that one size fits all is technically possible, but some people are going be left with a lot of excess while others will scarcely be able to breathe.</p></blockquote>




<p>Carrying on that metaphor, these pieces provided by Dojo &mdash; or any other comprehensive toolkit, for that matter &mdash; are but starter patterns, and thread, and scissors, and pins, and a sewing machine, and OK I&rsquo;m stretching the metaphor, now, but my point is they&rsquo;re definitely not finished one-size-fits-nobody garments. On the other hand, if I decide to use jQuery in a large application, it can feel like I&rsquo;ve been given a black marker and some of that crinkly brown paper, and now it’s up to me to draw a pattern and then come up with all those other pieces, too. Intellectually interesting and pleasingly crafty, perhaps, but not particularly efficient, sustainable, repeatable, or maintainable.</p>




<p>So again I ask, in all seriousness and in hopes of fostering a good discussion: Why? jQuery provides you with DOM, Ajax, and event management tools, but little else. There are tools <em>designed</em> for building large applications, designed to provide all of the pieces I want and so many more it&rsquo;s not even funny, and they provide you with DOM, Ajax, and event management tools, too. What&rsquo;s the compelling case for rolling your own solution that includes jQuery instead?</p>

    <updated>2010-08-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rmurphey.com/blog/2010/08/09/on-jquery-large-applications</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Update: I&rsquo;ve written a separate post on the wisdom of <a href="http://blog.rebeccamurphey.com/on-rolling-your-own">rolling your own</a> large application toolkit that incorporates jQuery.</em></p>




<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about JavaScript applications. As my skills have evolved, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of working on more actual applications, and I&rsquo;ve gotten further and further from clients who want to add a bit of Ajax or bling to an otherwise fairly traditional web site.</p>




<p>The most interesting applications I work on are client-side intensive: the server is responsible for providing data as JSON to the client, and most everything else &mdash; templating, state management, data management, site navigation, and of course user interaction &mdash; is left to the client side.</p>




<p>It&rsquo;s a lovely way of writing an application. There&rsquo;s no need for me to touch server-side code; in some cases I work with a server-side developer to decide what the data they send will look like, but in others I just take what an API already provides and make it work. I get to use the same templating framework across projects, regardless of server-side technology, and I can prototype complex interactions before the server side even exists.</p>




<p>This is a land where HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are almost all you need, and I like it. I&rsquo;ve become a firm believer in moving giant hunks of functionality that used to belong to the server over to the client. For a variety of reasons, I think it&rsquo;s clear that this is where most interesting web development is headed, to the extent it&rsquo;s not already there.</p>




<hr />




<p>This style of building an application changes the front-end development game. In fact, &ldquo;development&rdquo; may no longer be an adequate description; we&rsquo;re moving into the realm of engineering, here. We&rsquo;re not using JavaScript to add a bit of bling to our sites &mdash; a slideshow here, some Ajax there &mdash; we&rsquo;re architecting an <em>application</em>, damnit. We can&rsquo;t just write some procedural code that binds a bunch of anonymous functions to some events and call it a day; if we do, I can tell you from experience that we&rsquo;re going to end up with a steaming pile of unmaintainable crap.</p>




<p>Among a host of questions presented by these sorts of applications, some of the most interesting to me are:</p>




<ul>
<li>What are the units of functionality that will make up the application?</li>
<li>How will those pieces be organized into units of code?</li>
<li>How will those pieces communicate with each other?</li>
<li>How will dependencies between components be expressed and managed while adhering to the principle of loose coupling?</li>
<li>How will components manifest themselves in the DOM? Do they need to?</li>
<li>How will we persist data across URL and page loads?</li>
<li>How will we manage communication with the server?</li>
<li>How will we make sure users only see the data they&rsquo;re allowed to see?</li>
</ul>




<p>At the risk of making a broad generalization, this isn&rsquo;t the way today&rsquo;s average JavaScripter learned to think. The mantra of jQuery, the most popular JavaScript library on the internets, is &ldquo;get some elements, do something with them&rdquo; &mdash; perfectly terrible preparation for analyzing an application from a perspective other than the DOM. And, IMHO, therein lies a tremendous problem.</p>




<hr />




<p>As more and more application logic moves to the browser, I&rsquo;m eager to see the JavaScript community rise to the challenge, but instead it feels like the opposite is happening. People with little understanding or appreciation of these questions are taking on projects that demand these questions be answered. The result is a land of fragile code that gets the job done while giving the finger to the next developer; a land of code so tightly coupled, so deeply beholden to the DOM, so blatantly not reusable or extensible or maintainable as to render every subsequent commit a complete crapshoot, as liable to cripple the application as not. The viability of the project is threatened, and so is the reputation of JavaScript.</p>




<p>We are better than this. JavaScript, even that old-fashioned browser kind, is a language worthy of respect, not a thing to be dreaded. But &mdash; and here&rsquo;s the sentence I have struggled 10 months to realize and an hour to write: in order to prove that we are better than this, we must make abundantly clear to the budding developers, to the project managers, to the enterprises, to anyone intending to build a remotely complex JavaScript application, that there&rsquo;s more to JavaScript than jQuery. The questions are bigger, the answers more complex, and the relevant skills, alas, a bit harder to come by.</p>




<p>We have to make clear that, in fact, jQuery is but a hammer. When it comes to building these intensively client-side applications, we&rsquo;re talking about building skyscrapers, for god&rsquo;s sake. The problems solved by a hammer are the least of our concerns.</p>




<hr />




<p>It was just a few months ago that I gave a presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rmurphey/building-large-jquery-applications">building large jQuery applications</a>. I emphasized jQuery&rsquo;s role as strictly a DOM and Ajax tool, and demonstrated a few other tools &mdash; John Resig&rsquo;s <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/">simple inheritance</a>, James Burke&rsquo;s <a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> dependency management and build tool, Jan Lenhardt&rsquo;s <a href="http://github.com/janl/mustache.js/">mustache.js</a> &mdash; that one would want to bring to the table for such an undertaking.</p>




<p>But to what end do we assemble said hodgepodge of tools? Is it just so we can continue to &ldquo;use jQuery&rdquo;?</p>




<p>jQuery&rsquo;s API is, indeed, dead-simple, but we are smart people! We are building skyscrapers! When it&rsquo;s time to write a complex application, and we need all of these things that jQuery doesn&rsquo;t offer, can we not learn to use another hammer &mdash; learn that <code>dojo.place('&lt;div&gt;I am new!&lt;/div&gt;', oldDomElement, 'last')</code> means the same thing as <code>$('&lt;div&gt;I am new!&lt;/div&gt;').appendTo(oldDomElement)</code> &mdash; if learning it gives us access to legions more functionality than jQuery even aspires to provide?</p>




<p>Do we assemble this hodgepodge because finding jQuery developers is perceived as an easier task than finding practitioners of another library, even though someone saying they &ldquo;know jQuery&rdquo; is little indication that they will know how to work with the assembled solution?</p>




<p>Do we do it for the plugin ecosystem &mdash; full of code of varying quality and maintenance &mdash; even though many of the large application needs addressed by those plugins are addressed by other libraries as well, and sometimes better?</p>




<p>And when we do it, when we assemble this collection of tools ourselves, what risks are we accepting? What price will we pay down the road to maintain three or five or 10 different pieces from three or five or 10 different authors, with different release cycles, no guarantee of compatibility or maintenance, and no central project thoughtfully considering their future?</p>




<hr />




<p>I&rsquo;ve wrestled with these questions for months, agonizing during sleepless early-morning hours over how to advise clients on the answers. I&rsquo;m the co-host of yayQuery, a contributor to the jQuery Cookbook, and, I&rsquo;ll venture to say, a decently respected member of the jQuery community. I did not arrive at this conclusion lightly, and I have few illusions it will be well-received, or even heeded.</p>




<p>But I&rsquo;ve grown weary of people championing a tool that simply does not answer the big questions I see in project after intensively client-side project. I&rsquo;ve grown weary of those same people dismissing tools that answer those questions handily and have been answering them for a while now. I cringe when clients tell me they&rsquo;ve chosen jQuery because it was &ldquo;easy,&rdquo; and then watch them predictably struggle with all of the questions it does not answer. And I&rsquo;ve found I can&rsquo;t continue to bite my tongue when people recommend jQuery as an enterprise-grade solution while failing to acknowledge these questions, let alone answer them*.</p>




<hr />




<p>I do not want to see jQuery go away. The simplicity of its API was undeniably instrumental in the rise of JavaScript as a language these last few years. It is a perfect gateway drug, and I greatly enjoy watching people transition from &ldquo;get some elements, do something with them&rdquo; to the elegant patterns of JavaScript itself.</p>




<p>jQuery is an entirely appropriate answer to so many questions, but it falls so short for large applications, forcing you to assemble such a tenuous toolkit of your own, that it simply isn&rsquo;t a viable answer &mdash; or, in my opinion, part of an answer &mdash; for large applications. If we hope to continue to gain respect as a community, we ought to admire jQuery&rsquo;s immense contributions, but we must not be afraid to accept and make very clear its limitations. We do otherwise at our peril.</p>




<hr />




<p><em>*An aside: To its credit, <a href="http://jupiterit.com">JupiterIT</a> has put forward <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com">JavaScriptMVC</a>, the only substantive attempt I&rsquo;ve seen at answering these large application questions using jQuery. I applaud them, but fear their efforts will continue to be somewhat isolated without the support and endorsement of the wider jQuery community. If you have read this far and still have your heart set on a jQuery-centric large application solution, you should by all means take a look at JavaScriptMVC.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I've been leading <a href="http://www.rebeccamurphey.com/training">jQuery trainings</a> for more than a year now, from tiny gatherings that I organized myself at the local coworking space, to intensive two-day sessions at local web companies, to whirlwind one-day classes at governmental agencies. Over the course of those trainings, I've developed what I'd like to think is a decent curriculum -- training material that's the size of a small book, exercises that demonstrate core concepts, and solutions to those exercises that students can peek at later or when they get stuck.</p>

<p>I decided recently that it was time for all of this material to see the light of day, so I spent the last several days converting it all to DocBook files that allow for easy publication to HTML and PDF (and other formats, if I'm later so inclined). I also fleshed out some topics that I'd given short shrift, and started planning sections covering advanced topics such as plugin authoring, code organization, best practices, and more. There's more to come in the next few days, but I think what I've done so far is worth sharing. I hope you'll agree.</p>

<p>My goals in releasing this are several. First and foremost, I want to see people writing better jQuery. The free resources for learning jQuery are scattered across the internets, and my personal experience of learning the library was haphazard — it was a long time before I learned some things I wish I'd known from the get-go. In addition, I want people who are writing jQuery to understand JavaScript. To that end, the book begins with a survey of JavaScript itself before jumping into jQuery.  Finally, I want to enlist the bright minds of the jQuery community to help developing a robust, authoritative, in-depth jQuery curriculum, and in exchange it only seemed fair to make it available to everyone.</p>

<p>I should mention that the goal of this material is to serve as a companion to a human instructor. That said, individuals may find it useful for self-study, especially if they're diligent about doing the exercises at the end of each chapter.</p>

<p>If you're inclined to help -- by adding a chapter, a section, a paragraph, an exercise, or even just a correction -- fork the repo and send me a pull request. I look forward to seeing how this project might evolve with the community's help.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you comment on this post pointing out an issue with the material, I will do my best to tend to the issue, but I probably won't publish your comment, as this post isn't the right place for reporting issues in the code. You can <a href="http://github.com/rmurphey/jqfundamentals/issues">report issues at the repository</a>, but if it's important to you, <em>please</em> fork the repository, make the change, and send me a pull request.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7462067">yayQuery 1.0</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/yayquery">yayQuery</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>


<p>If you'd like a download:
<a href="http://paulirish.com/yayQuery/yayQuery_1.0.mp3">mp3 audio (30mb)</a>, <a href="http://paulirish.com/yayQuery/yayQuery_1.0.mp4">mp4 video (94mb)</a>, <a href="http://paulirish.com/yayQuery/yayQuery_1.0.ogv">ogg video (61mb)</a>, <a href="http://vimeo.com/7462067">Vimeo</a></p>

<p>In this our first episode of the official yayQuery Podcast, <a href="http://paulirish.com/">Paul Irish</a>, <a href="http://www.ajpiano.com/">Adam J. Sontag</a>, <a href="http://alexsexton.com/">Alex Sexton</a> and I stayed up way too late on Monday night and had ridiculous amounts of fun talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore.js</a>, the new functional programming JavaScript library. </li>
<li>The demise of Thickbox (and some good, modern alternatives).</li>
<li>Using (or not using) jQuery for mobile development.</li>
<li>Paul Irish's antipattern of the week: css(key, value)</li>
<li>$var vs. var (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation">Hungarian Notation</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>Perhaps because it was so late when we finished, there was also chair dancing. Make sure you don't miss it, but don't fast-forward to the end or you'll miss the good stuff.</p>

<p>This is our first try with this, and who knows what will become of it, but we're very grateful for any and all feedback. You can find us on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/yayQuery">@yayQuery</a>, or on the #jquery IRC channel. Enjoy!</p>
