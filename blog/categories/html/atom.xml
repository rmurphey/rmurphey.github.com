    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a couple of attempts that ended not-so-well, I gave up on HTML emails. I advise people to work with someone who's an expert with them, or to at least <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/">use templates that are known to work</a>, and then I wish them well. At a job interview I actually proclaimed my active dislike of HTML emails and general unwillingness to muck with them -- I'm not sure that went over so well. The news that <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2007/01/microsoft_takes_email_design_b.html">Outlook 2007 actually took a giant leap backwards in HTML support</a> seals the deal for me. Still, it's good to read that <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200712/the_email_standards_project_launches/">some people are trying to bring some sanity to the situation</a>. I wish them luck.</p>
